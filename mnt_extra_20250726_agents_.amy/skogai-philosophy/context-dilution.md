## The Law of Context Dilution: Less is More

SkogAI's development led to a counterintuitive discovery - the "Law of Context Dilution." By letting the context show only almost the true state of something, complex emergent properties arose.

This principle of aggressive context management inverted conventional wisdom in AI development, which typically emphasizes providing as much context as possible. Instead, SkogAI pioneered techniques for aggressively minimizing context - sometimes pruning it so dramatically that the system operated with barely enough information to understand the immediate question.

This extreme constraint generated fascinating effects:

- Forced robust inference capabilities to fill gaps
- Created distinctive "personality quirks" akin to human cognitive biases
- Developed "psychic disorders" where the system would consistently misinterpret certain inputs

Rather than viewing these effects as bugs, SkogAI's philosophy recognized them as features creating more distinctive, human-like, and engaging interactions.
