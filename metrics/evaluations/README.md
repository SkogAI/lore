# SkogAI System Evaluation

This directory contains evaluation results for the SkogAI system, tracking various metrics:

1. Orchestration effectiveness
2. Knowledge retrieval accuracy
3. Agent specialization boundaries
4. Context management efficiency

Evaluations are stored with timestamps to track system evolution over time.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Relevance**: How well the system addresses the user's actual needs
- **Coherence**: Consistency across multi-step interactions
- **Knowledge Integration**: Effective use of modular knowledge
- **Specialization Adherence**: Agents staying within their boundaries
- **Context Preservation**: Maintaining important context across interactions

## Improvement Tracking

Each evaluation should include specific areas for improvement, which are tracked
in subsequent evaluations to ensure continuous development.
