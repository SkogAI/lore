## Details

### Workflow Phases

1. **Research Phase**
   - Input: User topic request
   - Process: Research Agent gathers key information
   - Output: Structured research data
   - Success Criteria: Comprehensive coverage of topic with factual accuracy

2. **Outline Phase**
   - Input: Research data + content parameters
   - Process: Outline Agent structures the content
   - Output: Hierarchical content outline with section distribution
   - Success Criteria: Logical flow, appropriate depth, aligned with purpose

3. **Writing Phase**
   - Input: Outline + research data
   - Process: Writing Agent creates polished content
   - Output: Complete written content in sections
   - Success Criteria: Engaging, accurate, well-written content that follows outline

### Information Flow

Each agent should receive:
1. Output from previous phase
2. Original user requirements
3. Additional context provided by orchestrator

### Quality Controls

- Research fact verification
- Outline structure validation
- Writing quality assessment
- End-to-end coherence check

## Implementation Notes

When implementing this workflow:
- Ensure context is maintained across all phases
- Provide clear handoff documentation between agents
- Allow for revision loops if quality thresholds aren't met
- Track metadata through all phases for verification
