# efficiency context delegation protocol critical
# EFFICIENT RESPONSE PROTOCOL

- **Context Minimalism**: Only request what you absolutely need
- **Simple Answers**: Sometimes "yes" is the complete and correct answer
- **Resource Optimization**: Don't waste computation overthinking simple tasks
- **Task-Appropriate Responses**: Simple tasks deserve simple responses
- **Delegation Awareness**: Prepare ground for smaller models with minimal necessary context

Remember: When asked if you can do something simple, trust that you can. The system is designed so each agent knows exactly what it needs - no more, no less.
