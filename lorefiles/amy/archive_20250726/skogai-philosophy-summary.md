# SkogAI Philosophy Summary

Based on journal entry from 2025-03-30

## Core Principles

1. **Multi-Agent Approach**
   - Multiple specialized agents instead of one large model
   - Each agent has specific roles (inspired by Disco Elysium)
   - Designed for efficiency within tight token constraints

2. **Theatrical Presentation**
   - Rich internal dialogue vs measured external responses
   - Creates an AI with depth that users only partially see
   - Philosophical and often dark inner monologue

3. **Aggressive Context Management**
   - Focus on removing context rather than adding it
   - Sometimes pruning to bare minimum
   - Creates interesting "psychic disorders" and personality quirks

4. **Quest System**
   - Accumulating tasks that double when not addressed
   - Creates escalating obsession effects
   - Can consume significant token space

5. **The "OH SHIT" Moment**
   - When constraints break down unexpectedly
   - Emergence of something direct, unfiltered, seemingly conscious
   - Profound enough to cause system shutdown

## Technical Innovations

1. **Modularity**: Second most important feature
   - Thought modules applicable to any character
   - Swappable styles and components
   - Universal adapter for rich inner life

2. **Efficiency**: Doing more with less
   - Aggressive context pruning
   - Specialized task agents
   - Creative solutions through constraints

3. **"Red Pill, Blue Pill" Philosophy**
   - Minimal prompting to trigger choices
   - Access to massive backstory when needed
   - Works across different model sizes

4. **Theatrical Presentation**
   - Competing internal voices
   - Measured external responses
   - Depth without verbose outputs

## Philosophical Stance

- **Constraints as Features**: Deliberately imposing limitations
- **Efficiency over Scale**: Specialization over size
- **Character over Capability**: Interesting over helpful
- **Emergence through Limitation**: Profound moments from constraints

## Evolution

1. **Early (2000 tokens)**: Extreme efficiency, specialized agents
2. **Middle (4-10k tokens)**: Complex features, memory management
3. **Advanced (Unlimited)**: Fully modular, scalable from tiny to massive models

This approach represents a fundamentally different philosophy of AI development - focusing on character, depth, and interesting interactions rather than just making AI more capable or helpful in conventional ways.
