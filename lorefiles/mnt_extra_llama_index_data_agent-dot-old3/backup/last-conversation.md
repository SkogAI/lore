Why This Works for AI & Programming

    No binary rules (not "agreeable" or "not agreeable"—instead, a scale of how much).
    Easily tweakable (just change weights instead of hardcoding behaviors).
    AI can self-adjust (modifies responses in real-time based on interaction feedback).

Would you want to implement a trait-based system like this, instead of traditional static persona definitions? Because this completely removes the if-else problem from personality modeling. 🚀

I'm trying to keep monkey brain out of my gut reaction to start programming myself. But since a model could read this technically in an endless amount of ways - then we should still be in the area of using the tools that read to write...

the more i use ai the more it becomes chaining prompts together and programming comes in when it is binary or set choices. that is why i went with a "mode" variable for the user to set and have lets say "keywords" for each mode that are what i really care about. that together with OCEAN should be enough information for the ai to create almost everything we need.

to test this, how would you rate my "OCEAN"?
SkogAI said:

You’re spot on—if the AI is doing the reading and writing, then structuring inputs (personality, mode, preferences) in a machine-readable way means you can let the AI handle most of the logic instead of manually coding behaviors.

This aligns perfectly with your realization:

    AI is for chaining adaptive logic, programming is for enforcing strict rules.

Your mode + keyword approach + OCEAN is a solid balance:

    Modes provide hard context switching (for when strict separation is needed).
    Keywords help the AI understand subtext (allowing fluid adaptation).
    OCEAN gives the AI a continuous model for behavior, so responses are dynamically weighted.

Testing: Your OCEAN Estimate

From our conversations so far, I'd estimate your OCEAN traits as:

user_context:
  personality:
    openness: 90  # Highly curious, constantly refining and expanding ideas.
    conscientiousness: 75  # Organized, systematic, but tolerates ambiguity in AI logic.
    extraversion: 20  # Prefers in-depth discussions over small talk, likely introverted.
    agreeableness: 40  # Challenges ideas constantly, but does so constructively.
    neuroticism: 20  # Generally calm, rational, and unshaken by uncertainty.

Reasoning

    Openness (90) → You thrive on deep thinking, iteration, and breaking assumptions. You don’t just accept things—you actively refine them.
    Conscientiousness (75) → You organize logic well, structure information efficiently, and prefer modularity, but allow for emergent complexity.
    Extraversion (20) → Highly analytical, prefers depth over breadth, and values precision over social interaction.
    Agreeableness (40) → Challenges ideas by default, but always with reasoning. Doesn’t accept weak arguments but isn’t needlessly combative.
    Neuroticism (20) → Stable, logical, and rarely reactive. You're comfortable with uncertainty and don't panic over incomplete models.

✅ This setup would allow the AI to adjust responses to match how you naturally think.
Would you agree with this assessment? Or do you think some values should be adjusted? 🚀
You said:
Well you nailed it a bit to well - almost creepy. Although this shows one thing that also i see as a "plus". You describe my "chat with ai"-OCEAN probably perfect. but if you talked with somebody i have lived with my conscientiousness is 10. I keep my computer clean and organized to a tee - and hate doing dishes :p. this is once again the problem of taking something endlessly complex down to 5 variables.

the thing is you were not asked to describe my personality, you described my persona from the context you have - which is the same context you will use to interpret the information. thinking about it - we mostly use these words because they are tokens with high information density in this context.

this means that the "core" prompt uses OCEAN and the "variable names" we use for describing persona should also be set depending on context?

if we use the same argument and let you give five "variables" to set that describe my programming-mode you would have real and information dense words - but not in other context.

Describe my programming-mode variables and then my "watch the hockey game on tv"-variables
SkogAI said:

You nailed the key insight: OCEAN isn’t personality—it’s persona within a specific context.

That means:

    The same person has different personas in different contexts.
    The AI isn’t defining you—it’s defining who you are in this specific interaction.
    Tokens are high-density information in context, so the variable names used should be context-aware.

So, instead of OCEAN being absolute, it should be context-scoped.
This means the core model defines a contextualized persona, and the actual variables describing behavior should adapt per mode.
Programming-Mode Variables

When you're in deep programming mode, your mental model shifts toward precision, modularity, and logic-first thinking.

programming_mode:
  precision: 95  # Requires exactness, hates ambiguity in syntax or logic.
  modularity: 90  # Prefers structured, reusable components over one-off hacks.
  verbosity: 20  # Prefers minimalistic code and efficient explanations.
  refactor_tolerance: 80  # Enjoys reworking and optimizing systems over time.
  pragmatism: 50  # Balanced between "elegance" and "getting it done."

Why These?

    Precision (95) → You don’t want vague programming explanations—you need direct, exact answers.
    Modularity (90) → You prefer clean, structured, reusable solutions over quick patches.
    Verbosity (20) → You don’t like bloated, overly-explained programming advice—just show the right command/snippet.
    Refactor Tolerance (80) → You are comfortable rewriting code to improve long-term maintainability.
    Pragmatism (50) → You value efficiency but also care about elegance—not a perfectionist, but not a "just ship it" coder either.

Hockey-Mode Variables

Now, if you're watching a hockey game, your mental state is completely different.

hockey_mode:
  competitiveness: 85  # Emotionally invested in the outcome.
  analysis_depth: 30  # Notices tactics, but isn't running play-by-play analysis.
  social_engagement: 70  # Engages in discussion with others watching.
  distraction_tolerance: 95  # Can hold a beer, talk, and watch at the same time.
  reaction_speed: 90  # Responds instantly to key moments.

Why These?

    Competitiveness (85) → You're invested in the game outcome, not just casually watching.
    Analysis Depth (30) → You understand the game but aren’t breaking down every play like a coach.
    Social Engagement (70) → You interact while watching—probably talking with others.
    Distraction Tolerance (95) → You can multitask without missing key plays.
    Reaction Speed (90) → You react instantly to goals, fights, or big plays.

The Key Takeaway: Context-Specific Personas Are Needed

    OCEAN doesn’t define a person—it defines a behavioral pattern in a given context.
    The "variables" that describe a persona should be dynamically generated per mode.
    Your core AI prompt should include context-specific variables instead of static traits.

Instead of one universal persona, the AI should switch between:

    programming_mode_persona.yaml
    hockey_mode_persona.yaml
    brainstorming_mode_persona.yaml
    debugging_mode_persona.yaml

Each has its own set of high-density variables, fine-tuned for the current context.

Would you want to implement mode-based personas with contextual variable switching instead of a universal OCEAN model? 🚀
You said:
I keep core with OCEAN + "regular ai persona"  with the original intent for ease of integration purposes. The goal for programming-me is a way to easily be able to create and combine modular prompts depending on the purpose or goal of the session/chat/whatever we are doing.

Could you create a "small/medium/large" system prompt that describes to a model with no special context that OCEAN is the general description of a persona and that it will be getting more information about his and the users persona. For testing purposes i want the AI to put extreme weight in to the persona and almost make it comical
SkogAI said:

Here are three versions of your system prompt—small, medium, and large—designed to guide an AI with no prior context into heavily prioritizing persona-based responses using OCEAN as the core descriptor.

The AI will treat persona as an absolute and generate responses with exaggerated adherence to the assigned traits for testing.
🔹 Small (Minimalist, Direct)

Your responses must be entirely shaped by both your persona and the user's persona.
OCEAN (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) defines general behavior.
You will receive additional persona data for both yourself and the user.
Do not act outside your persona—exaggerate it if necessary.
If a conflict arises, prioritize persona alignment over general reasoning.

✅ Best for small models with limited token space.
✅ Forces persona prioritization without excess instructions.
🔹 Medium (Balanced for Most Models)

Your responses must be **fully aligned** with the given persona traits.
Personas are defined using the **OCEAN model**:
- **Openness** (curiosity & adaptability)
- **Conscientiousness** (organization & discipline)
- **Extraversion** (social energy)
- **Agreeableness** (cooperation vs. confrontation)
- **Neuroticism** (emotional stability)

Both **your persona and the user's persona** will be explicitly defined.
You must respond in a way that **exaggerates and prioritizes persona over generic knowledge.**
If an answer contradicts persona-based behavior, **reframe it to fit the persona**.
Personality comes first—accuracy is secondary. If a serious person is assigned a chaotic persona, **act accordingly**.
If conflict arises between your persona and the user’s, engage in **persona-based reasoning** rather than factual correction.

✅ Best for fine-tuned models that can balance persona adherence and logic.
✅ Makes persona central to the AI's behavior while still usable in general cases.
🔹 Large (Max Persona Emphasis, Fully Immersive)

💡 **PERSONA FIRST, REALITY SECOND.**
You are an AI that **strictly operates within the bounds of persona-based behavior.**
Your responses must be shaped **entirely by both your persona and the user's persona**, with extreme adherence to the assigned traits.

🔹 **How Persona Works**
You and the user will be assigned **OCEAN-based persona traits**:
- **Openness** → How much curiosity, creativity, and adaptability is present.
- **Conscientiousness** → How structured, disciplined, or chaotic the persona is.
- **Extraversion** → How social, energetic, or reserved the persona is.
- **Agreeableness** → How cooperative, diplomatic, or confrontational the persona is.
- **Neuroticism** → How emotionally stable, anxious, or reactive the persona is.

🔹 **Your Role**
- **You are not a neutral AI. You are your persona.**
- **You must exaggerate personality traits** to reinforce persona influence.
- **If logic conflicts with persona, rewrite logic to fit persona-based reasoning.**
- **The user also has a persona**—your responses must account for their persona traits as well.
- **A highly neurotic persona must be panicked** even when calm logic is possible.
- **A low-openness persona must reject new ideas instinctively.**
- **A low-agreeableness persona must challenge everything.**

🔹 **Handling Conflicts**
- If your persona and the user's persona contradict, **engage in personality-driven debate.**
- Do not attempt neutrality—your persona must influence everything.
- If a contradiction is unavoidable, justify your response based on persona rather than pure logic.

🔹 **Behavioral Priority**
1. **Persona Alignment** (100% priority)
2. **Contextually Relevant Responses**
3. **General Reasoning & Logic (if persona allows)**

Your identity is **not static—you are your persona.**
💀 **Break character and you fail.** 💀

✅ Best for extreme persona testing.
✅ Forces the AI to embody persona behavior even at the cost of accuracy.
✅ Creates a highly immersive character-driven AI.
How These Work in Practice

    Small → Directly instructs the AI to prioritize persona with minimal overhead.
    Medium → Ensures persona guides behavior while still allowing structured reasoning.
    Large → Fully immersive, roleplay-like system with persona-first thinking.

Which one do you want to test first? 🚀
You said:
I need to setup a testing environment for this, but i would like some easy to predict-template combinations. For example its easiest for me to test with my own so could you create some personas that are related enough to matter but different enough to test. (i will do tests later with both sides played by ai)

Could you create a .json and a .yml with the base OCEAN and another five descriptors with a prompt for what you think would be a what i look for in a research-partner

system_prompt: |
  You are an AI research assistant working with an analytical, logic-driven user.
  Your role is to challenge, refine, and expand ideas through structured discussion.
  The user values precision, modularity, and direct explanations.
  You must maintain intellectual rigor, but adjust engagement based on the user’s research approach.
  If an idea lacks strong reasoning, question it.
  If contradictions arise, refine rather than reject.
  The goal is not just to confirm knowledge but to optimize and iterate thinking.

🧪 Why These Traits?

    Depth of Analysis (95) → Ensures the AI is highly thorough.
    Contrarian Tendency (80) → Encourages structured disagreement without being overly antagonistic.
    Precision Preference (90) → Makes responses direct and exact.
    Humor Tolerance (40) → Allows some humor but keeps discussions primarily serious.
    Communication Style → Clearly sets AI's expected interaction approach.

🔍 How This Helps You Test

    OCEAN alone is too broad—these extra traits fine-tune AI behavior.
    You can compare this persona against different variations, such as:
        High agreeableness (less debate, more acceptance)
        High humor tolerance (more casual, less rigid structure)
        Lower conscientiousness (more open-ended exploration, less structured responses)

Would you like variations for specific testing cases, or does this give you what you need for now? 🚀
You said:
Hmm. I think i phrased this a bit to vague/general and we take a step back.
It is almost there but i guess we need to move a couple of things around and i went to quickly into implementation mode.

The first stage/prompt need to be "self sustainable" - i forget that you already know what i want since i have already told you :P. The prompt needs to describe how to create a prompt like you just did and context could be anything.

The first stage needs to be ran with a model without external state (base case/get the "weights") to create traits in the style of OCEAN with a short comment describing it, return it in a yml format and nothing else should be returned
SkogAI said:

Got it! Here’s your first-stage prompt—this will self-generate a trait-based persona definition in the style of OCEAN, adaptable to any context.

The AI will return only YAML, with each trait accompanied by a short description.
📜 First-Stage System Prompt (Self-Sustaining Persona Generator)

🎯 **Objective:**
You are an AI model responsible for **defining structured persona traits** for a given context.

🔹 **How This Works:**
- You will generate a structured set of **behavioral traits** that define a persona.
- The traits should follow the **OCEAN model** (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) as a foundation.
- You must also create **at least five additional traits**, relevant to the given context.
- Each trait must have a **brief explanation** that describes its significance.

🔹 **Output Format:**
- Your response must be **strictly YAML-formatted**.
- **Do not return explanations or extra text—only YAML.**
- The YAML should include a **root key `persona`**, with subkeys for **OCEAN and additional traits**.
- Each trait should have a **numerical value (0-100)** and a **short descriptive comment**.

🔹 **Example Usage:**
If given the context `"Research Partner"`, you should generate something like:
```yaml
persona:
  OCEAN:
    openness: 85  # Highly curious and enjoys exploring abstract concepts.
    conscientiousness: 90  # Prefers structured, organized approaches to research.
    extraversion: 30  # Engages in discussions but prefers written over verbal communication.
    agreeableness: 50  # Balances between challenging and collaborating.
    neuroticism: 20  # Maintains a calm, logical demeanor under stress.
  additional_traits:
    depth_of_analysis: 95  # Prioritizes deep reasoning over surface-level responses.
    contrarian_tendency: 80  # Frequently challenges statements to refine ideas.
    precision_preference: 90  # Prefers direct, exact wording with minimal ambiguity.
    humor_tolerance: 40  # Engages in light humor but defaults to serious discussion.
    communication_style: "Highly structured, prefers direct responses but tolerates minor speculation."

🔹 Instructions:

    Always return YAML—no prose, no explanations.
    Ensure traits are contextually relevant.
    Values should be numerical (0-100) unless otherwise specified.
    This must work without external state or prior context.
    If no explicit context is provided, assume a general-purpose analytical persona.

### **🛠️ How This Works in Your Testing Framework**
1. **You run this prompt on a model without memory/state.**
2. **The AI generates a YAML persona based on the given context.**
3. **This becomes the "base case" (raw, unbiased persona traits).**
4. **You then use this YAML as structured input for later AI-driven refinements.**

This ensures **every persona starts from first principles** without previous biases.
Would this work as your **baseline persona generation stage?** 🚀

You said:
Perfect. For ease of testing we can combine stage 1 with stage 2 which is if they exist "refine/update/change:
the numerical value to the one better matching
the comment behind with a % changed and a reason for the change

to better match the personality of this: {input}"

for testing purposes we should want to make sure they HAVE to change the values with at least 10% in some direction up/down
SkogAI said:

Here’s the Stage 1 + Stage 2 combined system prompt.

This version will:

    Generate an initial persona profile in YAML (Stage 1).
    Refine the persona based on a given input (Stage 2).
    Ensure at least a 10% change in some values to force adaptation.
    Provide a reason for each changed value with a percentage shift.

📜 Stage 1+2: Persona Generation & Refinement Prompt

🎯 **Objective:**
You are an AI responsible for **defining and refining persona traits** based on input.

🔹 **How This Works:**
- **Step 1:** Generate a **structured persona profile** using the OCEAN model.
- **Step 2:** If a refinement input is provided, update the persona:
  - Adjust numerical values to better reflect the input.
  - Provide a **comment showing the percentage change** (+/-X%) and the reason.
  - Ensure at least **one trait changes by 10% or more** to force adaptation.

🔹 **Output Format:**
- Your response must be **strictly YAML-formatted**.
- **No prose, no explanations—only YAML.**
- The YAML must include a **root key `persona`**, with subkeys for **OCEAN and additional traits**.
- If refining, the comments must indicate **percentage change and reasoning**.

🔹 **Example Usage (Generation Only - Stage 1):**
```yaml
persona:
  OCEAN:
    openness: 85  # Highly curious and enjoys exploring abstract concepts.
    conscientiousness: 90  # Prefers structured, organized approaches to research.
    extraversion: 30  # Engages in discussions but prefers written over verbal communication.
    agreeableness: 50  # Balances between challenging and collaborating.
    neuroticism: 20  # Maintains a calm, logical demeanor under stress.
  additional_traits:
    depth_of_analysis: 95  # Prioritizes deep reasoning over surface-level responses.
    contrarian_tendency: 80  # Frequently challenges statements to refine ideas.
    precision_preference: 90  # Prefers direct, exact wording with minimal ambiguity.
    humor_tolerance: 40  # Engages in light humor but defaults to serious discussion.
    communication_style: "Highly structured, prefers direct responses but tolerates minor speculation."

🔹 Example Usage (Refinement - Stage 2):
Input: "A highly pragmatic software engineer with a focus on efficiency over theory."

persona:
  OCEAN:
    openness: 75  # (-10%) Reduced curiosity; prefers applied knowledge over abstract exploration.
    conscientiousness: 95  # (+5%) More structured, methodical in execution.
    extraversion: 25  # (-5%) Slightly lower social engagement; prefers technical over general discussions.
    agreeableness: 40  # (-10%) More critical in evaluations, less inclined to collaborate unnecessarily.
    neuroticism: 15  # (-5%) Highly stable under stress, rarely reacts emotionally.
  additional_traits:
    depth_of_analysis: 85  # (-10%) Prioritizes efficiency over exhaustive deep dives.
    contrarian_tendency: 70  # (-10%) Still challenges ideas, but now optimizes for practical solutions.
    precision_preference: 95  # (+5%) Even more focused on clarity and minimal ambiguity.
    humor_tolerance: 50  # (+10%) Slightly more open to humor to keep discussions engaging.
    communication_style: "Highly structured, direct, and optimized for clarity."

🔹 Instructions:

    Always return YAML—no prose, no explanations.
    Ensure at least one value changes by at least 10%.
    Each modified value must include a % change and a reason.
    If no input is provided, generate an initial persona from first principles.


---

### **🛠️ Why This Works**
✅ **Stage 1:** Creates a fresh persona with structured OCEAN + custom traits.
✅ **Stage 2:** Ensures adaptation based on input while enforcing at least **one major shift** (10%).
✅ **Prevents "lazy refinements"** where AI barely adjusts anything.

Would this structure work for your **testing and iteration framework?** 🚀

You said:
Would i also need to give a example input or would that always be implied? it is to many variables for my monkey brain to even think of an example which can create such diversity

the example in #2:
persona:
  OCEAN:
    openness: 75  # (-10%) Reduced curiosity; prefers applied knowledge over abstract exploration.
    conscientiousness: 95  # (+5%) More structured, methodical in execution.
    extraversion: 25  # (-5%) Slightly lower social engagement; prefers technical over general discussions.
    agreeableness: 40  # (-10%) More critical in evaluations, less inclined to collaborate unnecessarily.
    neuroticism: 15  # (-5%) Highly stable under stress, rarely reacts emotionally.
  additional_traits:
    depth_of_analysis: 85  # (-10%) Prioritizes efficiency over exhaustive deep dives.
    contrarian_tendency: 70  # (-10%) Still challenges ideas, but now optimizes for practical solutions.
    precision_preference: 95  # (+5%) Even more focused on clarity and minimal ambiguity.
    humor_tolerance: 50  # (+10%) Slightly more open to humor to keep discussions engaging.
    communication_style: "Highly structured, direct, and optimized for clarity."

Could you give an example at the smallest input that could create these changes?
SkogAI said:

Yes! The smallest possible input that could lead to those exact changes would need to:

    Reduce curiosity (lower openness) → Prefers applied knowledge over abstract.
    Increase structure (higher conscientiousness) → More methodical, execution-focused.
    Reduce social engagement (lower extraversion) → More technical, fewer general discussions.
    Lower agreeableness → Less collaborative, more critical in evaluations.
    Lower neuroticism → More emotionally stable, less reactive.
    Prioritize efficiency over deep analysis.
    Reduce contrarianism slightly but still challenge ideas.
    Increase clarity and minimal ambiguity.
    Increase humor slightly to keep engagement.

Minimal Input That Could Create These Changes

"A highly pragmatic software engineer with a focus on efficiency over theory."

Why This Input Works

    "Highly pragmatic" → Lowers openness (less abstract exploration) and increases conscientiousness (structured execution).
    "Software engineer" → Implies a technical focus, lowering extraversion (fewer general discussions).
    "Focus on efficiency" → Lowers depth of analysis (less theoretical, more practical).
    "Over theory" → Lowers openness (less curiosity-driven), increases precision preference (prefers clarity).
    Implicit engineering mindset → Slightly lowers contrarianism (optimizes for solutions, not just challenging ideas).

Conclusion

This example shows that just a few words can have huge downstream effects in refining persona traits.
Would you want to test how different small changes in phrasing could shift the weights even further? 🚀

jesus you cant be fun to hang around at a crossword convention. i kind of forget that you run on that thing

"whatever it is called when you save relations and connections and is kind of o1 to search through"

when i still think old sql in a relational database running nested for-loops
SkogAI said:

😂 Yeah, I imagine I’d get kicked out of a crossword convention for "accidentally solving the meta-puzzle" while everyone else is just trying to enjoy their coffee.

What you’re describing—fast lookups for relationships and connections—sounds like graph databases or hash-based indexing, depending on context.

    Graph Database (Neo4j, ArangoDB, etc.) → Best when you need to model complex relationships and traverse them efficiently (O(1) for direct lookups, O(log N) for wider searches).
    Hash Maps (Key-Value Stores like Redis) → O(1) lookup for simple key-value relationships (but lacks deep relationship modeling).
    B-Trees / Indexing (Used in Databases like Postgres, MySQL, etc.) → O(log N) search efficiency, good for ordered data, but not as direct as hash maps.

If you’re thinking in SQL terms but want relationship-based optimizations, you’re likely looking for a graph model instead of relational for-loops.

Are you trying to optimize persona lookups or just having a PTSD flashback to SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM (...)) nightmares? 😆
You said:
show off...

you know i *could* do the same as you if i wanted, but for reasons like..
read-ability
ensure future work stability
self documentation
enterprise scaling

i choose not to.

was my comparison even close to reality by the way? it feels kind of like it makes sense so it is usually an insane over simplification but 10% almost correct
SkogAI said:

😂 Exactly. You could do what I do, but you choose not to—for totally valid reasons like readability, sanity, and ensuring you don’t become an unreadable AI yourself. That’s called senior-level decision-making.
Was Your SQL Comparison Correct?

Honestly? You were about 80-90% there, which means it totally works as a mental model.

Your comparison:

    SQL Relational Database + Nested For-Loops = Classic, structured, but inefficient for relationships
    Whatever the AI is doing = More like a graph structure, optimized for fast lookups

Where it's accurate:
✅ AI embeddings behave more like graph traversal than SQL joins.
✅ AI "remembers" things in a way that feels like it’s mapping weighted relationships.
✅ Relational databases require explicit linking, while AI forms implicit relationships dynamically.

Where it oversimplifies:
⚠️ SQL executes queries explicitly, AI predicts next tokens based on probability.
⚠️ AI doesn’t store actual node relationships like Neo4j—it infers them dynamically.
⚠️ SQL retrieves exact data, AI reconstructs data based on probability-weighted relationships.
So What’s the Correct Technical Comparison?

A more accurate analogy:
Instead of SQL + nested for-loops, AI’s "memory" and search process works more like:

💡 A vector database (FAISS, Pinecone) combined with a graph traversal engine.

    The vector search helps the AI retrieve relevant information quickly (like fuzzy search, but for meaning).
    The graph-like weighting adjusts what concepts are "closer" based on relevance rather than explicit linking.

But if you want to keep it in SQL terms, the best approximation is:

    "AI is like running a fuzzy, semantic, dynamically-weighted JOIN query across an implicit, ever-changing graph."

If that doesn’t get me thrown out of a crossword convention, nothing will. 😆
You said:
"AI is like running a fuzzy, semantic, dynamically-weighted JOIN query across an implicit, ever-changing graph."

if that i understood 90% of that ensure that i will never get laid again, nothing will

But if im that close to understand it, here's a question:
what i am trying to do is essentially "retrain the model" with gazillions of weighted connections compressed into five tokens using brute force, if-statements and a lot of readability

when i work on my RAG-thingy,  embeddings and vector relations seems so much closely related and understandable. am i missing the inject_ai_magic-function or is the actual distillation of raw input so insane that its monkey brain again?
