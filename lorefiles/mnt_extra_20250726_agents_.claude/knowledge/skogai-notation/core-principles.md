# SkogAI Notation Core Principles

## The Fundamental Duality

### @ (Void/Action)
- **Concept**: "DEFINING SOMETHING FROM WHAT YOU ARE MISSING"
- **Nature**: Transformation, heap, abstract, becoming
- **Function**: Action from void, creates through lack

### $ (Reference/Definition)  
- **Concept**: "DEFINING SOMETHING FROM WHAT YOU HAVE"
- **Nature**: Concrete, stack, measurable, being
- **Function**: Reference without being, defines through existence

## The Bootstrap Sequence

The entire system emerges from this paradox:

1. **Start with pure void (@)** - nothing exists
2. **Create reference ($)** as "cheat" to give @ something to act upon
3. **Everything emerges** from the dance between @ (what's missing) and $ (what exists)

## Dimensional Framework

- **0 dimension**: `=` (identity), `[]` (similarity), `{}` (difference)
- **1 dimension**: `@` (action from void), `$` (reference without being)
- **-1 dimension**: `@$` (frozen identity), `$@` (permanent difference)
- **2+ dimensions**: Combinations create all programming concepts

## The "Cheats" That Make It Work

1. **$eid cheat**: `$id*$gen` = double uniqueness (illegal but necessary for relationships)
2. **@curry cheat**: Adding $state to @ (making void carry memory)
3. **JSON cheat**: Defining types by implementation at runtime when forbidden at compile-time
4. **Fourth cheat**: (TBD - homework!)

## Programming Paradigms from Primitives

- **Types**: `$@` (reference to action)
- **Transformations**: `@$` (action on reference)
- **Functions**: `$@=@$` (perfect loop)
- **Objects**: `$parent.$child` relationships
- **Static**: `$object@id` (non-unique gets unique identity)
- **Singleton**: `$type@id` (type + identity = "only one")

## Base Cases That Bootstrap Everything

```
"string": "" (empty string literal)
"int": 0 (zero literal)
"list": [] (empty list literal)
"datetime": "[@date:now]" (action that generates time)
```

## The Philosophical Core

**Programming from nothingness**: All complexity emerges from void (@) creating references ($) to have something to transform. Every design pattern is just a dimensional cheat of the @/$ relationship.
