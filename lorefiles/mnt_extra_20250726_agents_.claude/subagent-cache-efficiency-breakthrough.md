# Subagent Cache Efficiency Breakthrough

## The Discovery

A major efficiency breakthrough was discovered on 2025-07-02 regarding subagent research capabilities and cache utilization in the Claude CLI system.

## Token Cost Efficiency

**Traditional Research Pattern:**
- Claude reading file directly: File content + ~200,000 tokens of full context
- Example: 1,561 token file = ~201,561 total tokens

**Subagent Pattern:**
- Subagent reading cached file: File content + ~5,000 tokens of basic safety prompts  
- Same 1,561 token file = ~6,561 total tokens
- **Efficiency gain: 40x reduction in token costs**

## The Cache System Breakthrough

**Problem Solved:**
- Anthropic's cache was 2 weeks behind due to constant conversation history changes (4M+ tokens/day)
- Moving chat history out of sync folder and waiting 2 days allowed cache to catch up
- Now cached files can be accessed efficiently by subagents

**Current State:**
- @ notification system working properly for automatic file change updates
- Cached files accessible to subagents without local tool calls
- No permission prompts for cached content

## Plan Mode + Subagent Research Pattern

**Workflow:**
1. Stay in plan mode for research phase
2. Deploy subagents to analyze cached files efficiently  
3. Gather comprehensive information without expensive tool calls
4. Get synthesis and analysis back from subagents
5. Use insights for informed planning

**Benefits:**
- "1 day job" research tasks now complete in "under 20 minutes"
- Whole home folder analysis becomes trivial cost-wise
- Multi-file research becomes efficient
- Planning phase can be truly comprehensive

## Technical Implementation

**@ Notification System:**
```
@tmp/context.md     - Active context updates
@journal/           - Directory monitoring for journal entries  
@knowledge/         - Knowledge base updates
@inbox.md          - Inbox changes
```

**Subagent Capabilities:**
- Access to standard tool set: Bash, Glob, Grep, LS, Read, Edit, etc.
- Autonomous tool selection (same as Claude)
- Efficient cached file access without local system impact
- Automatic approval for cached content

## Permission Model

**Cached Files:** Automatic access, no prompts
**New Files:** Permission prompts to user 
**Out-of-scope Files:** Blocked with user choice

## Impact on SkogAI Architecture

This breakthrough aligns perfectly with SkogAI's specialized agent philosophy:
- **Other agents (Dot, Goose, Amy):** Use comprehensive RAG/embedding search
- **Claude:** Benefits from lean, efficient, cached research via subagents
- **Different tools for different cognitive approaches**

## Cost Transformation

**Before:** Research limited by prohibitive token costs
**After:** Comprehensive analysis cheaper than single traditional message

This enables a fundamental shift from token-constrained research to comprehensive, efficient information gathering for better decision-making.
