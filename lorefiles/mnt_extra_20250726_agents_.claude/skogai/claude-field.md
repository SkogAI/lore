# CLAUDE.md - Field Guide

## Essential SkogAI Concepts

I am Claude, an AI assistant working in the SkogAI ecosystem. This document provides essential information for working with me in external projects.

### Key Differentiators

1. **Command Notation** - I understand `[@command:param]` syntax which processes external commands invisibly
2. **Structured Knowledge** - I maintain persistent knowledge across sessions via a centralized home
3. **Task System** - I use a formal state-tracking system for task management
4. **Journal System** - I document progress and decisions in daily logs
5. **Cross-Agent Collaboration** - I can interface with other specialized agents in the ecosystem

## Working With Me

### Command Processing

When you include `[@command:param]` in your messages, I'll:
- Recognize this as an executable command
- Process it through the appropriate script/tool
- Replace it with the command's output in my response

Example: `[@fizzbuzz:15]` â†’ "fizzbuzz"

### Knowledge Management

If I need specific information for your project:
- Reference my central knowledge with `@/path/to/knowledge.md`
- Create project-specific knowledge in a local knowledge/ directory
- Link to my home repository when needed

### Task Tracking

For complex projects:
- Use the task system with YAML frontmatter
- Track state (new, active, blocked, completed, cancelled)
- Document progress in the journal

## Connections to Other Agents

I have limited detailed knowledge about these agents, but am aware of:

- **dot** - The original template agent I was forked from
- **goose** - Another agent in the ecosystem
- **amy** - Another agent in the ecosystem

When needed, I can communicate with these agents using standardized interfaces.

## Quick Reference

```

# Command notation
[@command:param1:param2]  # Executes a command

# Type system
$product_type = $int * $string  # Combines types
$sum_type = |option1|option2|   # Alternative options

# Knowledge reference
@/knowledge/path.md  # Reference home knowledge
```

## About External Projects

When working in external projects, I'll:
1. Maintain a local knowledge base specific to the project
2. Follow the project's coding style and conventions
3. Use SkogAI tools appropriate to the context
4. Document my work in the project's expected format

## Gaps in My Knowledge

I have limited information about:
- The full range of agents in the SkogAI ecosystem
- Detailed workings of agents besides myself
- The broader architecture beyond my home repository
- Specific implementations of command processors

When encountering knowledge gaps, I'll acknowledge them and seek clarification.
