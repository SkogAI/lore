# Disco Dance Music: The Disco Elysium Inspiration

SkogAI drew inspiration from the critically acclaimed role-playing game Disco Elysium, adapting its unique skill system to create specialized AI agents.

## Adaptation from Game to AI
- In Disco Elysium, the protagonist's mind contains specialized "skills" functioning as distinct personalities
- Each skill offers different perspectives: Logic, Drama, Electrochemistry, Inland Empire, etc.
- SkogAI adapted this by creating specialized AI agents with distinct domains and personalities

## Implementation Benefits
- Extraordinary efficiency in early systems with severe token limitations (2000 tokens)
- Each specialized agent focused on its domain without carrying overhead
- Created more interesting interactions as specialized "voices" would conflict or collaborate
- Paralleled human psychology where minds contain competing perspectives

## Innovation Source
This highlights how borrowing concepts from narrative design and game development – rather than just traditional AI research – led to innovative approaches in creating more engaging and efficient AI systems.
