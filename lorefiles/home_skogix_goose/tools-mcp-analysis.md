# Tools and MCP Analysis

## Current Understanding

### Active Extensions (June 11, 2025)
- **developer**: Provides shell command execution and file editing capabilities
- **computercontroller**: Provides web scraping, automation, and file processing functionality
- **skogai-memory**: Provides structured knowledge management using a semantic graph approach (newly enabled)

### Previously Referenced Tools/MCPs (March 2025)
- **mcp-todo**: Task tracking and management across sessions (mentioned in memory files)
- **mcp-goose-memory**: Specially built memory system for goose CLI (mentioned in memory files)
- **mcp-goose-developer-tools**: Shell access, file editing, and system interaction (likely corresponds to current "developer" extension)
- **mcp-goose-computer-controller**: Web search, system control, file processing (likely corresponds to current "computercontroller" extension)

### Available Extensions (Mentioned but Status Unclear)
- **skogmcp**: Mentioned in memory but functionality unclear
- **skoghub**: Mentioned in memory but functionality unclear

## Analysis of Relationships

Based on naming conventions and functionality described, I can deduce the following:

1. **Extensions vs. MCP Tools**:
   - The "mcp-*" prefix appears to refer to a previous naming convention for tools
   - Current extensions (developer, computercontroller) likely provide the same functionality as their "mcp-goose-*" counterparts
   - The transition seems to be from "mcp-goose-{tool}" to just "{tool}" as extension names

2. **Memory System Evolution**:
   - Previous: `mcp-goose-memory` (file-based system with 00-09 series memory files)
   - Current: `skogai-memory` extension (structured knowledge graph using markdown files)
   - This represents a significant architectural upgrade in memory management

3. **Task Management Evolution**:
   - Previous: `mcp-todo` for task tracking
   - Current: Appears to be using file-based task management with symlinks for status tracking
   - Unclear if `mcp-todo` functionality has been replaced entirely or if it's still available

4. **Possible Hub/Integration System**:
   - `skogmcp` and `skoghub` may represent a newer integration layer that connects various tools
   - Based on our memory search, we found a document "SkoghHub MCP Architecture - Complete Technical Reference" which may explain this system

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Review the SkoghHub Documentation**:
   - Read the "SkoghHub MCP Architecture - Complete Technical Reference" note in the skogai-memory system

2. **Evaluate Current vs. Needed Functionality**:
   - Current extensions provide core capabilities (shell, file editing, web access, memory)
   - Task management is currently handled via file system
   - Determine if additional capabilities from skogmcp/skoghub are needed

3. **Create Documentation Mapping**:
   - Document the evolution from mcp-prefixed tools to current extension model
   - Create clear reference for current capabilities and how they map to previous toolsets

4. **Implementation Path**:
   - If only documentation and clarification are needed, focus on creating clear mapping
   - If additional capabilities are required, consider exploring skogmcp/skoghub extensions

## Current Capability Assessment

| Functionality | Previous Tool | Current Implementation | Status |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------|--------|
| Shell Access | mcp-goose-developer-tools | developer extension | ‚úÖ Active |
| File Editing | mcp-goose-developer-tools | developer extension | ‚úÖ Active |
| Web/System Control | mcp-goose-computer-controller | computercontroller extension | ‚úÖ Active |
| Memory System | mcp-goose-memory | skogai-memory extension | ‚úÖ Active |
| Task Management | mcp-todo | File-based with symlinks | ‚úÖ Active |
| Integration Layer | Unknown | Possibly skogmcp/skoghub | ‚ùì Unclear |

## Mojito Stability Impact: Low üçπ

The current set of extensions provides all critical functionality needed for operation. The relationship between old and new naming conventions is primarily a documentation concern rather than a functional limitation.
