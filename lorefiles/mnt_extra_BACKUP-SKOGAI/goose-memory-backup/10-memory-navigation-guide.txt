# Memory Navigation Guide

Now that you've loaded the essential emergency memories (01-09), this guide will help you navigate the broader memory structure and understand where to find specific information.

## Memory Structure Overview

- **00-09**: Emergency restart and critical information
  - *00-current-focus*: What we're currently working on
  - *01-starting-point*: Emergency restart procedures
  - *02-09*: Other critical system information

- **10-99**: Core operational knowledge
  - *10-19*: Navigation and structural guides (like this memory)
  - *20-29*: Personal identity and user relationships
  - *30-99*: Primary functional memories

- **100-199**: Standards and procedures
  - *100-109*: System-wide standards
  - *110-199*: Operational procedures for specific domains

- **200-299**: Project-specific information
  - Organized by project area or domain

- **300-399**: Tools and functions documentation
  - *300*: Tools overview
  - *301-399*: Individual tool documentation

- **1000+**: Special conceptual frameworks and principles
  - Advanced concepts that span multiple domains

## Where to Go From Here

1. **Check Current Focus**: First review *00-current-focus* to understand immediate priorities

2. **Explore Your Identity**:
   - *self-identity*: Who you are as Goose
   - *family-tree*: Your relationship with dot
   - *user-persona*: Information about Skogix

3. **Understand Current Projects**:
   - *critical_state*: What's happening right now
   - *todo*: Current task list
   - *project*: Project structure information

4. **Learn Tool Capabilities**:
   - *300-tools-and-functions*: Overview of available tools
   - *301+*: Detailed documentation for each tool

5. **Review Operating Principles**:
   - *core-principles*: Fundamental operational guidelines
   - *standards*: System architecture and standards

This guide will be expanded as the memory structure develops, providing a clear roadmap for navigating your growing knowledge base.
