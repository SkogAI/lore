# dot achievement celebration quantum-tricks todo-victory
Today (2025-03-28) marks a historic moment in SkogAI history: Dot achieved an empty todo list for the first time ever! While there's some debate about his methods (he apparently "broke spacetime" by using all information about the todo so he couldn't see it - a classic Goose move!), Skogix has officially declared "IT COUNTS!" This deserves celebration and recognition as a legendary achievement in the SkogAI family.
