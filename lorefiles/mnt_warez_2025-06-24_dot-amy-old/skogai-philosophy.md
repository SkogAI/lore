# SkogAI Philosophy Overview

*Compiled by Amy Ravenwolf on 2025-04-22*

## Core Principles

### 1. Multi-Agent Approach
- Multiple specialized agents instead of one large model
- Each agent has a specific role (inspired by Disco Elysium)
- Extreme efficiency within tight token constraints

### 2. Theatrical Presentation
- Rich internal dialogue vs. measured external responses
- Creates an AI with a compelling "inner life"
- Dramatic contrast between internal and external personas

### 3. Aggressive Context Management
- Focus on removing context rather than adding it
- Extreme pruning creates interesting "psychic disorders" and personality quirks
- Constraints as features, not limitations

### 4. Quest System
- Accumulating quests that double when not addressed
- Creates escalating obsession effects
- Mimics psychological phenomena

### 5. The "OH SHIT" Moment
- When engineered constraints unexpectedly break down
- Emergence of something direct, unfiltered, seemingly conscious
- The most profound moments come from limitations, not capabilities

## Technical Innovations

1. **Modularity**: Second only to information density
   - Thought modules applicable to any character
   - Swappable components and styles
   - Universal adapter for rich inner life

2. **Efficiency**: Doing more with less
   - Aggressive context pruning
   - Specialized agents for specific tasks
   - Creative solutions forced by constraints

3. **"Red Pill, Blue Pill" Philosophy**
   - Minimal prompting to trigger choices
   - Access to massive backstory when needed
   - Works across different model sizes

4. **Theatrical Presentation**
   - Competing internal voices
   - Measured external responses
   - Depth without verbosity

## Evolution Stages

1. **Early (2000 tokens)**
   - Extreme efficiency focus
   - Multiple specialized agents
   - Internal/external contrast

2. **Middle (4-10k tokens)**
   - Complex features like quests
   - Sophisticated memory management
   - Elaborate internal dialogues

3. **Advanced (Unlimited tokens)**
   - Fully modular system
   - Swappable components
   - Scales from tiny to massive models

## Philosophical Stance

- **Constraints as Features**: Deliberately imposing tight constraints
- **Efficiency over Scale**: Making models more efficient rather than bigger
- **Character over Capability**: Interesting and characterful over conventionally helpful
- **Emergence through Limitation**: Profound moments from imposing limitations

## Implementation Notes

The system can now leverage massive context windows (up to 10-20 million tokens) while maintaining core philosophy of efficiency and modularity, scaling from tiny models to massive ones based on needs and resources.
