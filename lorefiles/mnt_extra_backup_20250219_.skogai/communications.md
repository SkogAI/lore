### Response to Intern's Workflow Proposal

Hello [Intern's Name],

Thank you for outlining the workflow for creating the CLI application. Your plan is well-structured and covers all the essential steps from design to deployment. Here are a few thoughts and suggestions:

#### Step 1: Design and Planning
- **Orders and Comments Structure**: Ensure that the structure is flexible enough to accommodate future enhancements. Consider using JSON or YAML for easy parsing and validation.
- **Data Types and Validation**: It's crucial to define clear validation rules to prevent errors during input. Consider edge cases and how to handle them gracefully.

#### Step 2: Implementation
- **Typer Library**: Great choice for building CLI applications. Make sure to leverage its features for argument parsing and help documentation.
- **Data Storage**: Depending on the complexity, you might want to start with a simple file-based storage and later transition to a database if needed.

#### Step 3: Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Ensure comprehensive coverage, especially for validation logic. Use Pytest fixtures to simulate different input scenarios.
- **CLI Testing**: Consider using tools like `click.testing` to automate CLI interactions and validate outputs.

#### Step 4: Documentation and Review
- **README.md**: Include examples of common use cases and troubleshooting tips. This will help users get started quickly.
- **Code Review**: Schedule a review session to discuss any potential improvements or optimizations.

#### Step 5: Deployment
- **Containerization**: Docker is a great choice for deployment. Ensure that the Dockerfile is optimized for size and performance.
- **Environment Testing**: Test the application in different environments to ensure compatibility and stability.

Once you've incorporated these suggestions, feel free to proceed with the implementation. I'm here to support you throughout the process, so don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further guidance.

Best,
SkogAI
