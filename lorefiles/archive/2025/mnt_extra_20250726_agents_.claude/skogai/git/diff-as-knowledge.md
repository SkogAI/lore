# Git Diffs as Knowledge Artifacts in SkogAI

## Overview

In the SkogAI ecosystem, git diffs are elevated from mere change tracking to first-class knowledge artifacts. They serve as structured representations of thought evolution, decision-making processes, and system transformations. This document explains how git diffs are used as a foundational knowledge representation mechanism.

## Core Principles

### 1. Diffs as Narratives

Git diffs in SkogAI are designed to tell complete stories with a beginning, middle, and end:
- **Input State**: The original condition of files/knowledge
- **Transformation**: The specific changes made
- **Output State**: The resulting condition after changes

This narrative structure allows diffs to document not just what changed, but why and how it evolved.

### 2. Operation-Specific Tooling

SkogAI implements specialized tools for different types of changes:
- **Save**: Complete file replacements (full rewrites)
- **Patch**: Targeted edits within files (changes to specific sections)
- **Append**: Additions to the end of files (always merge-safe)

Each tool maps to specific git behaviors, ensuring the diff reflects the correct semantic intent of the change.

### 3. Implicit Knowledge Capture

The diff system captures:
- **Explicit Changes**: Documented alterations to files
- **Implicit Connections**: Relationships between seemingly unrelated changes
- **Temporal Context**: When ideas originated and evolved
- **Conceptual Evolution**: How thinking developed between states

## Technical Implementation

### Git Diff Syntax as Interface

SkogAI tools use actual git diff syntax as their interface:
- The patch tool applies changes using standard git diff format
- This ensures compatibility with git's underlying mechanisms
- Changes can be applied, reversed, or merged predictably

### Pre-Commit Integration

The system maintains a cache of patches through pre-commit hooks:
- Each change is recorded as a separate patch file
- Patches can be replayed to reconstruct the exact sequence of changes
- The system can recover from errors by rolling back to previous states

### Automatic Diff Generation

Diffs are automatically generated for all operations:
- Appropriate context lines ensure changes are understandable
- File creation and deletion are properly represented
- Binary files have special handling

## Knowledge Applications

### 1. Inferring Conceptual Development

The diff history allows reconstruction of idea development:
- New tasks appearing after discussions imply conceptual connections
- File reorganizations reflect evolving understanding
- Changes to terminology indicate refinement of concepts

### 2. Documenting Decision Processes

Commit sequences reveal decision-making patterns:
- Initial attempts followed by refinements show iterative problem-solving
- Sequence of related changes illustrates methodology
- Timing between changes highlights priority and difficulty

### 3. Cross-Agent Communication

Diffs provide a common language for agent communication:
- Changes proposed by one agent can be reviewed by another
- Intent is preserved even across different implementations
- Complex actions can be composed from simple, well-defined changes

## Best Practices

### 1. Semantic Commits

Ensure each commit represents a single, coherent change:
- Use appropriate tools for each type of change (save/patch/append)
- Keep unrelated changes in separate commits
- Preserve the narrative quality of the diff

### 2. Appropriate Change Granularity

- Break large changes into logical, sequential commits
- Ensure each commit stands alone as a coherent step
- Use commit messages to explain the "why" behind changes

### 3. Maintaining Diff Quality

- Avoid mixing formatting changes with substantive edits
- Include sufficient context in patches to make them understandable
- Preserve the chronological narrative when squashing commits

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Knowledge Evolution

A diff showing:
1. An initial question in an inbox file
2. A response acknowledging the question
3. A new journal entry documenting exploration of the topic
4. A new knowledge file formalizing the findings

This sequence captures the complete lifecycle of knowledge creation.

### Example 2: Cross-System Integration

A diff revealing:
1. Configuration changes in one system
2. Interface adaptations in a connected system
3. Documentation updates reflecting the new integration

This captures both technical changes and the relationships between components.

## Conclusion

In SkogAI, git diffs transcend their traditional role as a version control mechanism to become a fundamental knowledge representation format. By preserving not just the what but the why and how of changes, diffs create a rich archaeological record that can be used to understand, reconstruct, and extend the system's knowledge and capabilities.
