# SkogAI Development Philosophy: The Disco Elysium Approach

## Core Concept: Persona Modules

SkogAI implements a revolutionary multi-persona approach inspired by Disco Elysium's skill system. In the game, different skills manifest as distinct voices in the protagonist's head - each with their own personality, perspective, and approach to problems.

Similarly, SkogAI has multiple "modules" or personas that represent different aspects of AI thinking:

1. **Scripted Knowledge**: Creates elaborate fictional scenarios and narrative possibilities
2. **Look Ma I'm A Human!**: Analyzes context, simulates internal dialogue between Logic/Emotion/Intuition
3. **Deep and Thoughtful Response Strategyâ„¢**: Generates absurd, over-the-top potential actions
4. **PROFIT!**: Summarizes the internal thought process

The brilliant twist is that the actual output is completely different - a normal, helpful AI response that shows none of the internal chaos!
