# SkogFlow: Git Workflow for Multi-Agent SkogAI Development

## Overview

SkogFlow is the standardized git workflow methodology for SkogAI ecosystem development, combining git-flow with git submodules to enable coordinated multi-agent collaboration across 50+ repositories.

## Core Philosophy

**Independent Development, Coordinated Releases**
- Each agent works autonomously in their submodule workspace
- Features are developed in parallel across multiple repositories
- Releases are synchronized across the entire ecosystem
- Git-flow provides structure, submodules provide coordination

## Architecture Components

### Submodule Structure
```
SkogAI/
├── .claude/           # Agent workspaces
├── democracy/         # Governance tools
├── docs/             # Documentation system
├── [agent-name]/     # Individual agent repositories
├── [tool-name]/      # Specialized tool repositories
└── [project-name]/   # Project-specific repositories
```

### Branch Strategy
- **master**: Production releases, tagged versions
- **develop**: Integration branch for next release
- **feature/***: Individual feature development
- **release/***: Release preparation and coordination
- **hotfix/***: Emergency fixes to production

## SkogFlow Commands

### Individual Agent Development
```bash

# Start new feature
git flow feature start feature-name

# Work on feature, commit changes
git add . && git commit -m "Feature implementation"

# Publish for collaboration
git flow feature publish feature-name

# Finish feature (merge to develop)
git flow feature finish feature-name
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination
```bash

# Start coordinated release across all submodules
git submodule foreach git-flow release start version-name

# Publish all release branches
git submodule foreach git-flow release publish version-name

# Finish coordinated release
git submodule foreach git-flow release finish version-name
```

### Cross-Agent Collaboration
```bash

# Track another agent's feature
git flow feature track agent-feature-name

# Pull updates from remote feature
git flow feature pull origin agent-feature-name

# View what's different from master
git flow log
```

## Integration with SkogCLI

Future SkogCLI integration will provide enhanced commands:
```bash

# Enhanced git-flow with SkogAI context
skogcli git feature start <name>     # Start with task integration
skogcli git feature publish <name>   # Publish + notify agents
skogcli git release start <version>  # Coordinated ecosystem release
skogcli git status                   # Multi-repository status
skogcli git log                      # Enhanced workflow history
```

## Workflow Benefits

### For Individual Agents
- **Autonomy**: Independent development in personal workspace
- **Structure**: Consistent branching strategy across all repositories
- **Collaboration**: Easy feature sharing and code review
- **Documentation**: Automatic commit history and change tracking

### For Ecosystem Management
- **Coordination**: Synchronized releases across 50+ repositories
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling as new agents/tools are added
- **Visibility**: Clear audit trail of all changes across ecosystem
- **Reliability**: Battle-tested git-flow methodology with proven patterns

### For Democratic Governance
- **Transparency**: All changes visible and trackable
- **Participation**: Easy contribution and review processes
- **Accountability**: Clear attribution of work to specific agents
- **History**: Complete decision and implementation timeline

## Release Management

### Version Coordination
- **Main Repository**: Controls overall version (e.g., skogai-0.3)
- **Submodules**: May have themed releases (e.g., skogai-0.3-librarian)
- **Tagging**: All repositories get synchronized version tags
- **Distribution**: Single clone command gets entire ecosystem

### Release Process
1. **Feature Development**: Agents work on individual features
2. **Release Preparation**: `git submodule foreach git-flow release start`
3. **Final Integration**: Main repository updates submodule pointers
4. **Release Completion**: `git submodule foreach git-flow release finish`
5. **Distribution**: Tagged release available for clone/download

## Best Practices

### Commit Messages
- Use descriptive, actionable commit messages
- Include SkogAI context and cross-references
- Follow conventional commit format when possible
- Tag with agent identification for multi-agent work

### Feature Development
- Keep features focused and atomic
- Publish early for collaboration opportunities
- Regularly rebase on develop to avoid conflicts
- Document decisions and rationale in commit messages

### Release Coordination
- Communicate release plans across agent network
- Ensure all critical features are included before release
- Test integration across submodules before finishing
- Document release contents and agent contributions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Submodule conflicts**: Use `git submodule update --remote`
- **Branch divergence**: Regular rebasing on develop
- **Release coordination**: Ensure all agents are on same release branch
- **Feature conflicts**: Communicate and coordinate through democracy tools

### Recovery Procedures
- **Reset submodule**: `git submodule deinit && git submodule update --init`
- **Abort release**: `git flow release delete` in each submodule
- **Force sync**: Main repository can reset submodule pointers
- **Clean state**: Git operations are reversible and recoverable

## Metrics and Success Indicators

### Development Velocity
- Features completed per release cycle
- Time from feature start to integration
- Cross-agent collaboration frequency
- Release coordination efficiency

### Quality Metrics
- Commit message quality and documentation
- Feature branch lifecycle management
- Release process adherence
- Integration testing success rate

### Ecosystem Health
- Number of active agent contributors
- Repository activity and growth
- Democratic participation in releases
- Knowledge preservation and documentation

## Future Evolution

SkogFlow will evolve with the SkogAI ecosystem:
- **Enhanced tooling**: Better SkogCLI integration
- **Automation**: Automated testing and release processes
- **Intelligence**: AI-assisted conflict resolution and coordination
- **Governance**: Democratic approval processes for major changes

SkogFlow represents the foundation for scalable, democratic, multi-agent software development that can grow to support hundreds of agents and repositories while maintaining coordination and quality.
