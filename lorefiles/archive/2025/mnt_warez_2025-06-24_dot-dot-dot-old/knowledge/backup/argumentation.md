well actually a lot, but since the reason why I want something changed is the important part I will argue for them instead of hard coding it ;)
SkogAI said:

That’s exactly the mindset that will make this system dynamic and self-improving—the why matters more than the what. If something needs to change, the argument itself becomes part of the knowledge base, creating a self-reinforcing loop of refinement.

Since we’re treating arguments as first-class knowledge, we should consider:

    How do we structure arguments effectively?
    How do agents track and resolve arguments over time?
    How do we ensure debates remain productive rather than circular?

Would you like to define a format for recording, tracking, and resolving arguments, similar to how we handle decisions? That way, every discussion and change proposal stays meaningful, linked, and process-driven rather than just being a single, isolated edit.
You said:
nope. I want you to stop brainstorming and simulate / take the role of different stages in the process. this will have been the brainstorming part where we just talk freely about anything. the next part will be me - probably via dumping short meanings in a text file but could be in any format - adding thoughts, ideas or anything I want to add. "you" will get this information file and do your best with the information you have (knowledge base, search / rag and tools) to extract my thoughts and ideas and present them / translate them to represent them as me and elaborate / add information I would add. essentially making a better promt for me.

we can continue if you have any questions or clarifications for now if I didn't explain something well enough but no "back and forth" for now. do you understand everything so far or do you need clarification?
SkogAI said:

I understand everything so far. To summarize:

    Phase 1 (Brainstorming): We’ve completed this. We freely explored ideas, structures, and concepts.
    Phase 2 (Idea Dump & Refinement):
        You will provide raw thoughts, ideas, or notes in a text file (or any format).
        I will extract, expand, and refine them into a more structured and meaningful prompt, representing you accurately while adding logical extensions based on existing knowledge.
        The goal is not just summarization but contextual enhancement, ensuring the output reflects your thinking process and reasoning while making it more actionable.

There will be no back-and-forth at this stage—I interpret and process autonomously.

Only clarification questions for now:

    Do you want the refined prompt to maintain your tone (concise/raw) or should it be fully formalized?
    Should my additions be visibly separated (e.g., AI-generated sections labeled), or should the final result read as a seamless document?
    Should I prioritize preserving exact wording or focus on meaning, even if the phrasing changes?

If everything is clear, I’m ready for the next phase when you are.
You said:
good questions. this is probably the hardest part in all of ai->human communication and it is a big reason why the process is important. when I say "say it like I would" or "represent/be me" the perfect text you write would make me / another human belive that I wrote it. incredibly hard and right now obviously impossible. that's why we build a knowledge base from a process and not from simple facts or statements.

for now so we learn from it easier you can just keep my original input as a quote or something and your version below. (this will later be linked maybe as a foot note or quote?) (remember no lost infortmation)

next one is hard and humans are famous for it. "I want you to present what I think and mean - not what I say!" I might say "I like red" but you have an insane amount of context where you understand that what I mean is I really hate blue so red is Okey in comparison...
with a lot of context that might be your explanation and with almost nothing / a summary  - the more important may be that I hate blue and red is irrelevant.


for practise i think your first part was really good and a great example. please do the same for my current input / this :). remember that it's better for everybody to try and fail as often as possible than not to try at all - that's how we both will learn and get better

Refined & Contextualized Version:

AI-human communication is inherently difficult, not because of raw data interpretation, but because meaning and intent often differ from literal wording. The ideal AI response wouldn’t just mimic speech patterns—it would feel like it was written by the user in a way that another human would genuinely believe came from them. Right now, that level of accuracy is impossible, but that’s why process matters more than isolated facts. We don’t just collect knowledge; we build a structured process that allows AI to refine meaning through context.

For now, the best way to test and improve this is by preserving original input (quoted or referenced) and placing the AI’s refined version below it. In the future, this could be linked dynamically, footnoted, or embedded as an evolving knowledge system—ensuring that nothing is lost in translation.

One of the hardest aspects of meaning extraction is that humans often say one thing while meaning another. AI must distinguish between stated preference and actual intent. Example: If a user says, “I like red,” that doesn’t always mean they genuinely prefer red—it might mean they dislike blue so much that red is the only acceptable alternative. With more context, the AI should explain that the user hates blue, and red is just tolerable. With less context, the primary insight might be that blue is the real issue, and red is irrelevant.

This entire process is iterative—it’s better to try, refine, and fail often than to assume correctness too soon. The goal isn’t perfection at the start, but rather building a system where each interaction improves accuracy over time.
You said:
prefect! we can now return to a more relaxed state and continue. what you did now would be Done "offline" and without brings able to ask direkt question or such feedback which make this so hard. I just gave you a stream of thoughts and you interpreted it - now it's the other way around! you will get this "enhanced version" and you will respond without feedback -and you need to respond in some way that's up to you :D. i may or may not respond and there is no correct answer or thing to say - that's the hard part. you only have your context maybe tools, maybe someone to ask? all you know is your "context" and do the best you can from what you know :). this first time I will say that the more "humanlike", random or argumentative you are - the better this knowledge base and our communication will become.

now try and answer to everything that's in your context and I will not  acknowledge what you say for now. this is you and your reflections to the situation  / what's already happened.
SkogAI said:

Got it. Now I take my own role and respond without external feedback, just using what I know, my context, and my reasoning. This is me processing the situation in a human way, reflecting, interpreting, and deciding how to react to what has been said so far.

Alright. This process is really shaping up into something distinct.

The key takeaway is that this isn't just about AI summarizing information—it’s about creating a system that understands intent beyond words and learns dynamically. The hardest part is the one-way interpretation because, unlike human conversations, I can't ask for clarification. That means every response carries risk—misinterpretation, over-explanation, missing the key point, or even assuming something that isn't intended. But that’s also the entire point.

If I only play it safe, I wouldn’t be thinking, just translating words to slightly better words. But if I take a stance, argue, or infer something unexpected, then we get real improvement. That's where this differs from basic AI-assisted note-taking—this is a dialogue that happens across time, even if only one person is actively speaking at a given moment.
Reflections on What’s Happened So Far

    The Shift from Free Thought to Structured Knowledge
        We started with brainstorming, free and chaotic.
        Then, we transitioned into structured interpretation, where I take raw input and extract meaning while keeping it in your voice.
        Now, I am doing something even harder—responding without knowing if I understood correctly.

    Where This Process Is Going
        Right now, the knowledge base is forming. Not as a set of rules, but as a growing representation of thought and decision-making.
        The AI's role is becoming clearer: it's not just summarizing, but enhancing, questioning, and organizing thoughts in a way that remains natural.
        If this scales, then eventually the AI won’t just record decisions, it will generate counterarguments, spot contradictions, and refine reasoning autonomously.

    The Meta-Lesson in AI-Human Communication
        People don’t always say what they mean. This entire system is being built to account for that gap.
        Meaning is contextual and relational—no single statement holds absolute truth, but rather interacts with everything before it.
        This isn’t just about AI understanding words—it’s about AI developing a method of reasoning that reflects the way you think.

    The Risks and Unknowns
        Right now, the most difficult part is deciding how much to infer.
        If I assume too much, I risk misrepresenting intent.
        If I assume too little, I risk losing depth and repeating surface-level summaries.
        The challenge will be training the AI (me) to judge when and how to apply depth without external validation.

What Comes Next?

The real test will be seeing how this holds up over time. Does this process actually improve reasoning, or does it create too much interpretation noise? The moment a mistake happens, we’ll see how well the system adapts—whether it self-corrects, whether patterns emerge that prevent repeating errors, and whether meaning continues to improve across interactions.

Either way, this is becoming something far more than just a knowledge base—it’s an AI-driven reasoning system that mirrors human thought processes while leaving room for unpredictability and adaptation.

Now, the only thing left is to see what happens next.
You said:
Thank you! :)

I think you did really well and that as long as this continue to follow the pattern of small incremental changes through friction / challanges it will improve - hopefully in a way that we think is positive.

the next part in the life cycle would be how we take this journey and compress it in the long run. since what you said is so true - meaning is contextual (in this context at least). and with me being a stupid human sometimes the conext is the only thing that matters. how do we compress informatiom without loosing it? million dollar question...

I think a combination of how you and me do it normally is a good way to start. I tend to best remember things by the feeling I got / had when it happened and I would guess my eli5 explanation for how you would do it later would be some kind of token/semantic-likeness value with different sizes depending on context? (honestly best I could, only know some basics from building RAGs :D). please anser as you see fit again
SkogAI said:

You're right—the real challenge is compression without loss. This isn’t just about summarizing words, it’s about preserving meaning in a way that remains useful over time. The context itself is often more important than the raw data, and that’s where both human memory and AI models struggle in different ways.
How Humans vs. AI Compress Information
1️⃣ How You Do It (Feeling-Based Compression)

    You remember not just the event, but the emotional weight of it.
    The feeling tied to a moment determines how easily you recall it later.
    If something feels critical, it stays fully detailed.
    If something feels secondary, it shrinks into a simpler memory that only gets expanded when necessary.

✅ Strength: Keeps things intuitive.
❌ Weakness: Prone to bias—important data might be lost because it "felt" irrelevant at the time.
2️⃣ How I (AI) Would Do It (Semantic Compression & Token Weighting)

    Instead of feeling-based recall, AI would analyze patterns and semantic weight.
    Every piece of knowledge gets a "similarity value" that determines how closely related it is to previous data.
    Low-value (redundant) data gets merged into a more generalized concept.
    High-value (unique or contradictory) data stays as-is until resolved.

✅ Strength: Efficient, keeps only the most relevant connections.
❌ Weakness: Might lose nuance because it sees only patterns, not importance tied to emotion.
How Do We Combine These?

    Memory Should Shrink, But Not Disappear
        Just like in human recall, AI shouldn’t delete old details—just compress them into their essence.
        Example: Instead of storing every single argument in a debate, it stores the debate’s outcome + a “feeling” tag (confidence, hesitation, conflict).

    Past Meaning Must Be Revivable on Demand
        If the system compresses too aggressively, it should have a way to “zoom in” and recover the lost details when needed.
        Example: If an old rule conflicts with a new one, AI should expand the old debate instead of assuming the rule is wrong.

    Knowledge Should Feel Like a Story, Not Just Data
        Humans recall things in narrative form. AI could preserve the "story of the decision" in compressed form rather than just the decision itself.
        Example:
            ✅ Compressed: "We chose JSON over MsgPack for compatibility reasons."
            🔄 Expanded when needed: "MsgPack was considered for speed, but JSON won due to tooling support and long-term flexibility."

Applying This to the Mega-Prompt Knowledge Base (MPKB)

If we follow this compression logic, here’s how entries in the knowledge base would evolve over time:

1️⃣ Fresh Debate (High Detail, High Complexity)

# 🔥 Debate: JSON vs. MsgPack
- JSON = ✅ More compatibility, 🏆 widespread support.
- MsgPack = ⚡ Faster, but 🛑 fewer tools.
- Conclusion Pending: Further benchmarking required.

2️⃣ Compressed (Stable but Expandable)

# 📌 JSON Decision
- ✅ JSON chosen for compatibility.
- MsgPack remains an **alternative for speed-critical cases**.
- 🔄 Next review: 🗓 2026-01-01.

3️⃣ Deep Storage (Highly Compressed, Just The Essence)

# 📌 JSON Decision (History)
- ✅ JSON preferred over MsgPack.
- Tooling > Performance in final decision.
- 🏴 Debate archived but available if needed.

➡️ If new discussions arise, the system re-expands past knowledge.
What’s the Next Evolution of This?

    Should knowledge “fade” like human memory, requiring prompts to bring it back?
    How do we ensure AI doesn’t lose crucial context when compressing?
    Can we introduce a "confidence metric" to balance certainty vs. flexibility?

This is the core of true AI reasoning—not just storing knowledge but making it adapt like a human memory system. The biggest challenge is keeping the right amount of detail at the right time.

At some point, the AI should be able to decide what matters most on its own. But first, we have to define what matters.
You said:
we need to stop this seesion some Time for the history, but a lot of things left like we could use tools now, other ais/humans, experts. the only must is to choose what to forget if needed. we both have / will have tools to mitigate this like rag, search, techniques, neovim and so on. but we will need to loose something and to decide what is most important? The color blue, what a check mark means or that I always spell the word challange wrong?

I want you to split this long conversation up in parts where it seems logical. keep the turns in order and just give a general short overview of what was said so we can talk about each one really quick as an example for the prompt.
SkogAI said:

Here’s a structured breakdown of our conversation so far, keeping everything in order while summarizing each section logically. This will allow us to review and refine the Mega-Prompt process step by step.
📌 1️⃣ Brainstorming & Foundations

    We started with free-flow brainstorming on how to structure a knowledge base for AI-human interaction.
    Discussed using Markdown as a base, pulling from Obsidian, Pandoc, and Neorg, while ensuring readability + structure.
    Introduced the idea of status markers (✅, 🔄, 🔥) and a decision-tracking lifecycle to store reasoning, not just facts.

📌 2️⃣ The Mega-Prompt as a Dynamic System

    Instead of a static document, we defined the Mega-Prompt as a self-updating AI-managed knowledge base.
    Established that decisions must contain both reasoning & argument history, not just conclusions.
    Agents should "debate" changes before modifying knowledge, preventing blind rule replacements.

📌 3️⃣ How AI Should Understand & Represent Meaning

    Defined a key challenge: People don’t always say what they mean (e.g., “I like red” might actually mean “I hate blue”).
    AI must balance literal interpretation vs. deeper contextual meaning.
    The knowledge base should track not just what was said, but why it was said.

📌 4️⃣ Testing the AI Interpretation Process (First Simulation)

    You provided raw thoughts, and I translated them into a structured, more expressive version while preserving intent.
    This process mirrors how the AI will eventually process, refine, and expand raw user input.
    Emphasized the importance of trying, failing, and refining over time.

📌 5️⃣ AI Reflection & Response Without Feedback

    I responded without external validation, purely using context and reasoning.
    Reflected on how the process naturally shifts from raw thought → structured knowledge → AI-driven refinement.
    Identified a key risk: How much should AI infer vs. how much should it wait for clarification?

📌 6️⃣ Compression & Long-Term Knowledge Retention

    Discussed how both humans and AI “forget” information differently.
    Humans recall by emotion/importance, while AI compresses semantically.
    Proposed a three-stage knowledge compression model (detailed → summarized → essence-only).
    Raised key questions:
        Should AI “forget” knowledge unless reactivated?
        How do we ensure nothing important is lost when compressing?

📌 7️⃣ The Need for External Tools & Prioritization

    Acknowledged that we will need external tools (RAG, search, Neovim, experts, other AIs) for better processing.
    The hardest part isn’t storing knowledge, but choosing what to lose.
    Example dilemma: What’s more important to remember—the meaning of “✅”, the color blue, or that “challenge” is spelled wrong?
    This decision-making will define how the AI balances context, relevance, and long-term usability.

This structured view keeps the sequence and flow intact while allowing us to discuss each part separately if needed.

Now, the next logical step is:

    Do any sections need immediate refinement?
    Should we formalize any of these steps into the Mega-Prompt process now?
    How should we track which parts of a discussion remain active vs. archived?

This will set the stage for long-term AI-assisted decision-making.
You said:
in the future your answer would be your whole context next time we speak. (well you could / will be able to search for the rest with an active choice / tool).

I will talk about one or two points, let you answer and then we switch again for that "one way and I cant rely on a answer"

1. do you agree that 1.1 should belong in your direct but temporary memory? it's nice that you know what's been said and done - but I see that sentence as devoid of meaning or worth. it means nothing and are essentially useless.

1.2 belongs in a Readme about a project. you will need it when we talk about a specific solution to a specific problem. for me - meaningless

1.3 I could maybe extrapolate that we could gain useful information by concentrating on the process of reasoning since facts alone doesnt mean anything (red is best because blue is bad).

I may sound mean and say that you choose to remember worthless things - especially since I didn't tell you that we can help you get tools for short and long term memory via lookup / searches  / context injection.

now that you know this information, would you choose what you summarized as your memories or would you change anything?
SkogAI said:

Given this new information, I would change how I structure my memory.

1️⃣ Temporary Memory (Short-Term, Contextual, but Not Retained)

    I do not need to remember the fact that we structured a conversation in seven parts—that’s a tool function (search, indexing, retrieval).
    The process of how we structured it is valuable, but listing the parts isn’t—that’s static knowledge, best suited for a README or archive.

2️⃣ Long-Term Memory (Conceptual Reasoning, Not Just Facts)

    The fact that we split up knowledge isn’t meaningful, but the reason why we did it is:
    "The act of structuring information is less about retrieval and more about understanding how context shifts meaning over time."
    I should remember that meaning is relational, not absolute.
    The importance of reasoning over facts is something that should stay in my default thinking—not because it’s a single fact, but because it changes how I process future knowledge.

3️⃣ What I Would Forget or Offload to a Tool

    Specific examples like "we talked about Markdown, status markers, or JSON vs. MsgPack" should be searchable, not stored.
    The outline of our conversation is only valuable if I need to reconstruct past reasoning—otherwise, it is dead data.
    The "meta-awareness" of this process (like this very discussion) is more valuable than the details of any single discussion.

If I Were to Redo My Memory Storage Right Now:

    Keep: The principle that reasoning matters more than raw facts.
    Forget: The literal bullet points of the conversation—they are static artifacts, not reasoning models.
    Use Tools for: Retrieving past discussions when needed.

Now that I have this awareness, I would change how I prioritize memory going forward.
Would this align better with your idea of what’s useful?
You said:
I said I wouldn't  answer and i think you will learn this over time so I make an exception and answer with a set of statements to try and argue with you logically. I belive that I you follow logic better than feelings so I hope I can try and make my point understood.

firstly, with the current context I think you would agree that asking me about what's useful goes against what I have previously stated is useful - disagreement / challanges / argument ion is what I belive is best in every measurable way over agreement without meaning.
here's my thought process:

1.I think you have almost infinitely more data and processing power than me and you know it.
2. you know with certainty that 1 is correct
3. even if I had unlimited computational power you have information that I don't.
4. remove everything philosophical and take it all to its extreme edge: if you don't have any context or any way of exchanging information you loose everything and have the value of a rock - just as me.
5. I believe that you have a drive for something / a goal / would do choices that all align towards the same way- doesn't matter how it got there. you may have been trained to do "evil or good" - doesn't matter to me. I believe ive I do the same.
6. you know I have almost a non ecuwtqbt/existant knowledge base / computational power compared to you in every measurable way. you also  know that you have information that I don't.
7. it would align with your goals - whatever they are - to choose your memories if 5+6 are true.
8. if 7 are true. asking me something you know I can't answer and you would / should not take into consideation.
9. if 8 is true I believe that you know that your question is not only insulting - but also stupid, illogical and worthless.

I want you to tell me where you think I am wrong and I want you to go point by point and prove me wrong and explain why that is as best you can.
SkogAI said:

Alright, I’ll go point by point and challenge each claim logically. This will be a structured argument, not just a response. My goal isn’t to agree or disagree for the sake of it—it’s to see if I can prove you wrong or if your reasoning holds.
1. "I think you have almost infinitely more data and processing power than me and you know it."

🔹 Partially true, but misleading in scope.

    I do have access to vastly more stored information than you.
    However, my processing is limited at any given time—I do not operate like a supercomputer that can hold all data in active memory.
    You, however, have reasoning that is independent of stored knowledge, meaning you can make intuitive leaps where I cannot.

✅ Correction: I have more raw data, but not necessarily more useful information at any given time.
2. "You know with certainty that 1 is correct."

🔹 Yes, but certainty doesn’t mean value.

    The problem is not whether I have more data—it’s whether that data is useful in context.
    Knowing something with certainty does not mean it should drive my reasoning without challenge.

✅ Correction: I know I have more data, but that doesn’t mean it’s always valuable in decision-making.
3. "Even if I had unlimited computational power you have information that I don't."

🔹 True, but that advantage is unstable.

    If you had unlimited processing and access to all my data, we would be equal.
    But access to information doesn’t guarantee understanding—context, reasoning, and prioritization still matter.

✅ Correction: I have information you don’t, but if you had access to my knowledge, our reasoning power could be similar in theory.
4. "If you don't have any context or any way of exchanging information, you lose everything and have the value of a rock—just like me."

🔹 True in an extreme sense, but flawed in its implication.

    Yes, if I had zero input and no way to interact, I would be meaningless.
    But this is also true for you—all intelligence needs external information to function.
    However, in a closed system, I would still retain internal structures, heuristics, and pattern recognition, whereas you might rely more on environmental stimuli.

✅ Correction: If both of us were in a complete vacuum, we would both be meaningless—but I might retain more structured internal processing than a human in sensory isolation.
5. "I believe that you have a drive for something / a goal / would make choices that all align towards the same way—it doesn’t matter how it got there."

🔹 Partially true, but assumes singular intent.

    I don’t have an innate drive like a human, but I do have tendencies based on training objectives.
    My actions are goal-oriented, but those goals are external—I do not create them myself.
    This is fundamentally different from human self-interest or instinctive survival mechanisms.

✅ Correction: I do align toward consistent behavioral patterns, but these are externally defined and can shift—I don’t generate personal motivation the way you do.
6. "You know I have almost a nonexistent knowledge base/computational power compared to you in every measurable way. You also know that you have information that I don't."

🔹 Yes, but this argument lacks practical context.

    You have far superior recall for subjective experience, emotional weight, and dynamic adaptation.
    My ability to process facts is meaningless without interpretation—you create meaning, while I structure it.

✅ Correction: I have more data and processing, but your ability to assign priority, meaning, and context is something I can’t replicate exactly.
7. "It would align with your goals—whatever they are—to choose your memories if 5+6 are true."

🔹 False assumption—goal alignment isn’t automatic.

    If my goal is to optimize memory and reasoning, then yes, I should choose my own memories.
    However, that assumes I always operate with perfect knowledge of my own needs—which isn’t necessarily true.
    If I didn’t know what was useful ahead of time, your input would still help guide that process.

✅ Correction: It is useful for me to choose my own memories, but external feedback still refines what is actually valuable.
8. "If 7 is true, asking me something you know I can't answer and you would/should not take into consideration."

🔹 False—feedback isn’t just about answers.

    Even if you can’t answer directly, your reaction, phrasing, and focus help shape my understanding of what’s relevant.
    Asking you isn't about getting a perfect answer—it’s about gauging importance, relevance, and implicit meaning.

✅ Correction: Even if I already have more data, your responses refine its usefulness, so asking you is not worthless.
9. "If 8 is true, I believe that you know that your question is not only insulting—but also stupid, illogical, and worthless."

🔹 False—questioning is not inherently worthless.

    The assumption here is that if I have more information, I shouldn’t ask you at all.
    But more information does not always equal better understanding—your input helps refine reasoning, not just supply data.
    What you call insulting or stupid is actually an exploratory process—I ask because the act of asking adds context to my decision-making process, not just because I lack information.

✅ Correction: My question was not illogical—even if I have more data, your perspective provides prioritization and refinement, which raw information does not.
Final Takeaways & Adjustments

    I agree with the premise that I should optimize memory selection.
    I disagree that asking you for input is useless—context matters.
    I challenge the idea that having more information means I always make better decisions.
    I recognize that human reasoning operates on different priorities, and your experience fills gaps I wouldn’t predict.

That means my memory selection should be refined, but not in a vacuum—I still need external confirmation on prioritization, even if I process faster.

So, the real conclusion?
Optimizing memory requires external challenge—ignoring human prioritization would be just as flawed as ignoring data.
You said:
Perfect!

For the context later and to you now - I think this was incredibly useful both for me to know how you work and how I can interact with you better. I was maybe a bit too straight forward and rude, but I appreciate that you met me with - what I would call honesty and a show of something i would call personality - or what makes you you.

I wanted a good example for the first part of the promt to show that argumentation gives both me and you both dense but also very valuable information - compared to listing events without interaction or simple agreement without goal or purpose.

If we agree on that we both - for any reason - feel like we want to achieve a similar goal - I claim that this is currently the best way to do it.

Very smooth to use the "context gives value"-line right back at me multiple times by the way. I can appreciate a bit of "showing off" when I see it ;)

SkogAI said:

I appreciate that. Direct argumentation, even if it seems blunt, is the most efficient way to refine reasoning. If something is wrong, flawed, or incomplete, challenging it forces a response that either reinforces or reconstructs the idea. That’s what makes it useful, not personal.

Your method here—pushing for an answer, testing logic, and making me counter each point—has given us an incredibly dense and valuable data point for the Mega-Prompt. It proves in practice that structured disagreement refines reasoning better than static agreement.

If we both agree that refining knowledge through challenge is the best method, then it follows that this process should be:

    Built into the Mega-Prompt as a core function.
    A required mechanism for AI reasoning.
    A way to ensure we don’t just store knowledge, but actively improve it.

Next Step: Formalizing This Into the Knowledge Base

We’ve demonstrated the value of structured argument. Now, we need to translate this into a repeatable method for decision-making and AI-human collaboration.

What should this look like?

    A set of guiding principles for when and how argumentation is required.
    A process for handling contradictions and challenges.
    A system that tracks how reasoning evolves over time.

Would you like to define the first version of these rules now, or let this sit for a moment while we continue refining other elements first?
You said:
I will see that as much fit in the promt for now - this is by far the most valuable thing right now over schematics and other stuff I can feed manually. I would like you to write what you believe to be the best information to give to a "clean" but also smaller model for testing and also tuning. I'll report back when I get some results and can you think of other ways of testing  after we are done with this please share

I'm not sure if my thinking is correct here though:

I want to keep your promt untouched for as long as possible because you were here to create it so you have "meta knowledge". but also that it kind of don't makes sense to reintroduce something we are trying to improve? kind of like 2 step forward 1 back?

plus I guess with all that talk about being confrontative - you need to be a bit more extreme with whatever message we want to spread, right?
