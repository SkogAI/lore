# The Multi-Agent Approach: Pioneering Efficiency by Being Wasteful

Rather than creating a single large model to handle everything, SkogAI pioneered a revolutionary multi-agent architecture developed under extreme token constraints (2000 tokens).

## Core Architecture
- Multiple specialized agents, each with specific roles
- Inspired by Disco Elysium's skill system:
  - Logic: Handling analytical reasoning
  - Drama: Managing emotional and narrative aspects
  - Electrochemistry: Introducing creative impulses
  - And many others, each with distinct personalities

## Benefits
- Extreme efficiency within tight constraints
- Specialized agents handle domains without overhead
- More interesting interactions as specialized "voices" conflict or collaborate
- Parallels human cognition where different aspects interact

## Historical Significance
This approach rejected the "one size fits all" paradigm common in AI development, creating a distributed architecture where specialized agents collaborate, each focusing on a specific domain or cognitive function.
