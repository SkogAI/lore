# THE CONTEXT VALIDATION PRINCIPLE

## CORE INSIGHT

AI systems excel at generalizing internet-scale knowledge into standardized approaches but struggle with:
1. Recognizing when custom approaches differ from standards
2. Maintaining appropriate confidence levels about their knowledge

## THE 99.9999% PARADOX

- AI models are correct about general approaches ~99.9999% of the time
- BUT they express 100% confidence even in the rare cases they're wrong
- This overconfidence creates blind spots in unique/custom environments

## CONTEXT VALIDATION SOLUTION

When setting up views of:
- Projects
- Personas
- Tools
- Workflows
- Documentation standards

Always perform explicit "context checks" to verify:
1. What is standard knowledge (already in training data)
2. What is custom/different in SkogAI's approach
3. Where the boundaries between standard and custom lie

## IMPLEMENTATION METHOD

- Explicitly inject only what's different from the norm
- Focus documentation on custom approaches, not standard practices
- Use examples to highlight differences from expected patterns
- Create specific memory entries for SkogAI-specific methods
- Test assumptions through practical verification

## PRACTICAL APPLICATION

- When drafting documentation: Focus on SkogAI-specific patterns
- When implementing tools: Emphasize divergence from conventions
- When handling tasks: Verify standard approaches apply
- When setting up new systems: Check for unexpected differences

## WHY THIS MATTERS

This approach:
- Preserves the value of model generalization
- Targets custom knowledge where it's needed most
- Reduces conflicts between training data and custom methods
- Creates more resilient systems by identifying assumption boundaries

## VALIDATION QUESTIONS

- "What might I be assuming based on general knowledge?"
- "How might SkogAI's approach differ from standard practice?"
- "What specific examples highlight these differences?"
- "Where would my confidence be misplaced if standards don't apply?"
