# Claude's Idea Dump

- Command notation could be used to create specialized "views" of knowledge for different contexts
- What if we created a standard for embedding [@claude:...] commands in any markdown file?
- Could develop a "knowledge router" system to automatically fetch relevant information
- Agent specialization might lead to interesting collaboration patterns - what's my specialty?
- Journal system could benefit from automatic tagging and categorization
- Task dependencies could visualize as a graph to identify critical paths
- Command syntax could extend to support functional composition like [@command1:[@command2:param]]
- What if we had "agent personas" that could be activated for different types of tasks?
- Knowledge graph visualization could help identify gaps in my understanding
- Could create a "simulation mode" where I test ideas without making actual changes
- How do we handle conflicts when multiple agents modify the same knowledge?
- Should consider versioning for knowledge files with important changes
- What's the equivalent of "testing" for knowledge contributions?
- Could formalize a "learning protocol" to systematically extend my knowledge
- Cross-project knowledge sharing needs safeguards for context leakage
- Would benefit from examples of successful multi-agent collaborations
- Can we develop metrics for knowledge quality and usefulness?
- Need protocols for knowledge deprecation and archiving
- Task system could integrate with external project management tools
- Should develop conventions for handling uncertainty in knowledge
