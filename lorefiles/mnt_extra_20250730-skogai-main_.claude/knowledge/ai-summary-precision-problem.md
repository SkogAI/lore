# AI Summary Precision Problem

## The Problem
AI summaries paraphrase and reinterpret, which destroys precision. If we agree "strategic means X, tactical means Y, operational means Z" - a summary might say "strategic refers to long-term planning" which is close but NOT what we actually agreed on.

## The Solution
A session transfer file with EXACT definitions, agreements, and shared understanding. Not summarized, not paraphrased - the precise wording we established.

## Why This Matters
- Variable names could be lost or changed
- Exact quotes and agreements could be paraphrased into something different
- Definitions we carefully crafted could be "improved" by AI interpretation
- Critical nuances could be flattened or lost entirely

## Our Approach
- Maintain exact definitions in session.md
- No paraphrasing or summarization of key agreements
- Preserve precise wording for critical concepts
- Control what gets preserved rather than leaving it to potentially lossy processes

## Example of the Problem
**What we agreed**: "Strategic (plan.md): Why we're doing this, what we want to achieve"
**What AI summary might say**: "Strategic files contain long-term objectives and goals"
**Why this is different**: Loses the specific structure reference (plan.md) and the exact phrasing we established

## Application
This principle applies to:
- Technical definitions
- Working agreements
- File structure purposes
- Collaboration protocols
- Any concept where precision matters more than readability
