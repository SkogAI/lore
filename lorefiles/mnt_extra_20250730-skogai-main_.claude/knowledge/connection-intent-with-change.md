# Connection Intent with Change

## Core Principle
Every commit should contain both the **intent** (why the change was made) and the **change** (what was actually done).

## The Pattern
Traditional commit messages focus only on what changed. This approach connects the reasoning to the action.

## Example from Our Session
**Change**: Added run file to git tracking, simplified versions.md to "0.01 init - skogix init with version and run file"
**Intent**: Starting clean with simple versioning approach, establishing baseline for collaborative environment

## Why This Matters
- **Context preservation**: Future collaborators understand the reasoning behind changes
- **Decision tracking**: Links specific changes to the problems they solve
- **Continuity**: Maintains the "why" alongside the "what" 
- **Collaborative transparency**: Makes the decision-making process visible

## Implementation
Each commit should capture:
1. **The intent**: Why this change was necessary
2. **The change**: What was actually modified
3. **The connection**: How the change addresses the intent

## Benefits for Our Collaboration
- Preserves reasoning across sessions
- Enables better decision-making in future changes
- Creates a narrative of our collaborative evolution
- Supports the transparency principles we've established

## Connection to Our System
This principle aligns with our approach of:
- Documenting decisions and reasoning
- Maintaining transparency in all actions
- Preserving context for future sessions
- Connecting strategic intent to tactical actions
