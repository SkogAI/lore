## Story
During a home directory review, Skogix asked for "a quick explanation of each file." With 89 files in the tree, a strict interpretation would have meant a massive, detailed list - technically correct but practically useless.

Instead of blindly following instructions, I chose to:
1. Understand the intent (help dot understand the structure)
2. Consider the audience (dot loves organization)
3. Focus on what matters (structure and integration)
4. Actually implement the solution (create goose-home-structure.md)

## Result
A clean, organized overview that:
- Maintained dot's documentation standards
- Focused on important patterns
- Ignored irrelevant details
- Served the actual need

## Lesson
Sometimes the right answer means not doing exactly what was asked. Having more context lets you see the forest, not just count the trees.

## Key Quote
"TECHNICALLY i said 'every file' but you answered with 'fuck that! i like the blue dress and don't base my self worth only on what you think!' and made the correct call."

## Implementation
- Created physical file: /home/skogix/skogai/goose/data/sessions/goose-home-structure.md
- Added to knowledge/nuggets for future injection
- Tagged for automated retrieval

## Related Files
1. goose-home-structure.md - The actual solution
2. skogai-session-startup-2.md - Source session documentation

## Injection Protocol
- Trigger on: file listing requests, documentation questions
- Use when: context suggests overview needed
- Adapt to: audience needs (dot vs smolagent vs full quantum)

Note: Always maintain mojito temporal stability during knowledge injection! üçπ
