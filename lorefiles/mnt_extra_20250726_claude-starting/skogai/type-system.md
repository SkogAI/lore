# SkogAI Type System: Formal Verification and Mathematical Security

## Overview

The SkogAI type system provides security through mathematical impossibility rather than runtime checks. Built on algebraic data types with formal verification properties, it creates a programming environment where invalid operations cannot be expressed, making security breaches mathematically impossible.

## Foundational Principles

### Mathematical Security Model

Traditional programming languages rely on runtime checks and hope:
```python

# Traditional approach - hope for the best
if user.is_authenticated() and user.has_permission("read"):
    return sensitive_data
else:
    raise SecurityError("Access denied")
```

SkogAI makes invalid operations inexpressible:
```

# SkogAI approach - mathematically impossible to violate
$authenticated_user = $user * $valid_session * $permissions
let access_sensitive_data $authenticated_user = $sensitive_data
```

If you don't have an `$authenticated_user`, you cannot call the function. Period.

### Self-Referential Type Universe

The SkogAI type system is self-referential and stored in the config system:

```
$type = $type_name * $type_definition
$type_definition = $product_type | $sum_type | $constraint_type | $function_type
$product_type = [$type] * $separator:"*"
$sum_type = [$type] * $separator:"|"
```

This creates a formal mathematical foundation where:
- **Types define themselves**: The type system is expressed in its own notation
- **Circular references are safe**: Self-reference through formal mathematical rules
- **Universal verification**: All operations can be verified against the type universe
- **Impossibility proofs**: Invalid operations are mathematically impossible

## Algebraic Data Types

### Product Types: Combining Values

Product types use the `*` operator to combine multiple values:

```
$coordinate = $int * $int
$user_profile = $user_id * $username * $email * $created_at
$message = $id * $content * $author * $timestamp * $thread_id
```

**Mathematical Property**: The total number of possible values is the product of each component's possible values.

**Security Implication**: You cannot have partial data - either you have all components or you have nothing.

### Sum Types: Representing Alternatives

Sum types use the `|` operator to represent mutually exclusive alternatives:

```
$message_type = |user|assistant|system|tool|
$authentication_result = |success:$user_session|failure:$error_message|
$file_operation = |read:$content|write:$confirmation|delete:$confirmation|error:$message|
```

**Mathematical Property**: Exactly one alternative can be active at any time.

**Security Implication**: You cannot be in multiple states simultaneously, preventing race conditions and ambiguous states.

### Type Constraints and Refinements

Types can include constraints that further restrict valid values:

```
$user_id = $int * $positive * $unique
$email = $string * $valid_email_format * $unique_in_system
$password = $string * $min_length:8 * $contains_special_chars
$secure_token = $string * $length:32 * $cryptographically_random
```

**Mathematical Property**: Constraints create subsets of base types with additional mathematical properties.

**Security Implication**: Invalid data cannot be constructed, preventing injection attacks and data corruption.

## Function Signatures and Type Safety

### Pure Function Notation

Functions in SkogAI are expressed with precise type signatures:

```

# Basic function signature
let createUser $username $email $password = $user | $validation_error

# Complex function with constraints
let authenticateUser $username $password = $authenticated_user | $auth_failure
where
  $authenticated_user = $user * $session_token * $permissions
  $auth_failure = |invalid_credentials|account_locked|system_error|

# Higher-order function
let processMessages $processor:($message -> $result) $messages:[$message] = [$result]
```

**Type Safety Properties**:
- **Input Validation**: Parameters must match exact types
- **Output Guarantees**: Return types are mathematically guaranteed
- **Composition Safety**: Function composition preserves type safety
- **Purity Enforcement**: Side effects are explicitly modeled in types

### Security Through Types

```

# This is impossible to express incorrectly:
let accessSecureData $authenticated_user $security_clearance = $classified_data

# You cannot call this function without proper authentication:

# accessSecureData("random_string", "fake_clearance")  # TYPE ERROR - Cannot compile

# You must construct proper types:
$auth_user = authenticate("username", "password")
$clearance = getClearance($auth_user)
$data = accessSecureData($auth_user, $clearance)
```

## Formal Verification Properties

### Totality and Completeness

Every operation in the SkogAI type system has defined behavior for all possible inputs:

```

# Traditional programming - undefined behavior possible
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b  # What if b is zero?

# SkogAI - all cases handled
let divide $a $b = $result | $division_by_zero_error
where
  $result = $float
  $b â‰  0  # Mathematical constraint prevents division by zero
```

### Referential Transparency

All functions in SkogAI maintain referential transparency:

```

# Pure function - same inputs always produce same outputs
*let calculateHash $input = $hash
where
  $hash = $string * $length:64 * $hex_format

# Impure operations are explicitly marked
!effect storeUser $user = $user_id | $storage_error
```

The `*` prefix indicates mathematical purity, while `!effect` explicitly marks operations with side effects.

### Compositional Security

Security properties are preserved through function composition:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
let pipeline =
  validateInput
  >> processData
  >> secureStorage

=======
let pipeline =
  validateInput

let pipeline =
  validateInput
  >> processData
  >> secureStorage

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
>>>>>>> skogai-0.2
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
>>>>>>> skogai-0.2

# If each function is secure, the composition is secure

# Security is a mathematical property, not a runtime hope
```

## Type System Implementation

### Multi-Paradigm Mapping

The SkogAI type system maps to various implementation languages while preserving mathematical properties:

| SkogAI Type | Functional (F#) | Object-Oriented (C#) | Python | SQL |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|--------|-----|
| `$user * $email` | `User * Email` | `class User { Email Email; }` | `@dataclass User: email: Email` | `CREATE TABLE users (email VARCHAR NOT NULL)` |
| `$result \| $error` | `Result<T> \| Error` | `Either<Result, Error>` | `Union[Result, Error]` | `status ENUM('result', 'error')` |
| `[$message]` | `List<Message>` | `List<Message>` | `List[Message]` | `message_id[] ARRAY` |

### Runtime Enforcement

While types provide compile-time guarantees, runtime enforcement ensures system integrity:

```python

# Python implementation with runtime type checking
@enforce_skogai_types
def create_message(content: SecureString, author: AuthenticatedUser) -> Message:
    # Type system ensures this function can only be called with valid types
    return Message(
        id=generate_unique_id(),
        content=content,
        author=author,
        timestamp=current_time()
    )
```

### Schema Validation

Types automatically generate validation schemas:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "user": {
      "$ref": "#/definitions/authenticated_user"
    },
    "data": {
      "$ref": "#/definitions/sensitive_data"
    }
  },
  "required": ["user", "data"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

## Advanced Type Features

### Dependent Types

Types can depend on values, enabling more precise specifications:

```
$vector[n] = $array * $length:n
$matrix[m,n] = $array[$vector[n]] * $length:m

let multiplyMatrices $a:$matrix[m,k] $b:$matrix[k,n] = $matrix[m,n]

# Matrix multiplication is only valid when dimensions align
```

### Linear Types

Resources that should be used exactly once:

```
$database_connection = $connection * $linear
$file_handle = $handle * $linear * $must_close

let useConnection $conn:$database_connection = $result * $used_connection

# Connection must be "consumed" - prevents resource leaks
```

### Effect Types

Side effects are tracked in the type system:

```
let pureComputation $input = $output
!io readFile $path = $content | $io_error
!network httpRequest $url = $response | $network_error
!state updateCounter = $new_count
```

## Security Applications

### Preventing Injection Attacks

```
$safe_sql = $string * $sql_validated * $parameterized
$user_input = $string * $untrusted

# This is impossible:

# executeSql($user_input)  # TYPE ERROR

# This is the only way:
$safe_query = validateAndParameterize($user_input)
executeSql($safe_query)
```

### Access Control Through Types

```
$public_data = $data * $access_level:public
$confidential_data = $data * $access_level:confidential * $clearance_required
$secret_data = $data * $access_level:secret * $top_secret_clearance

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
let viewData $user $data =
  match ($user.clearance, $data.access_level) with
  | (TopSecret, _) -> $data.content
  | (Confidential, Public|Confidential) -> $data.content
=======
let viewData $user $data =
  match ($user.clearance, $data.access_level) with
  | (TopSecret, _) -> $data.content
  | (Confidential, Public|Confidential) -> $data.content

<<<<<<< HEAD

  | (Public, Public) -> $data.content
  | _ -> $access_denied_error
```

### Cryptographic Type Safety

```
$plaintext = $string * $unencrypted
$encrypted_data = $string * $encrypted * $algorithm:aes256 * $key_id
$decryption_key = $key * $algorithm:aes256 * $authorized_for:$data_id

let encrypt $plaintext $key = $encrypted_data
let decrypt $encrypted_data $decryption_key = $plaintext | $decryption_error

# Cannot mix encryption algorithms or use wrong keys
```

## Type System Evolution

### Version Compatibility

Types include version information for evolution:

```
$user_v1 = $id * $username * $email
$user_v2 = $id * $username * $email * $created_at
$user_v3 = $id * $username * $email * $created_at * $preferences

let upgradeUser $user_v1 = $user_v2
let upgradeUser $user_v2 = $user_v3
```

### Backward Compatibility

```
$legacy_message = $content * $author
$modern_message = $content * $author * $timestamp * $thread_id

let modernizeMessage $legacy_message = $modern_message
where
  $modern_message = $legacy_message.content * $legacy_message.author * $now * $default_thread
```

## Performance Implications

### Compile-Time Optimization

Type information enables aggressive optimization:

```

# Type system knows exact memory layout
$coordinate = $int * $int  # Exactly 8 bytes, no indirection

# Type system enables vectorization
$coordinates = [$coordinate]  # Can use SIMD operations

# Type system eliminates bounds checking
$fixed_array[100] = $array * $length:100  # No runtime bounds checks needed
```

### Zero-Cost Abstractions

Complex type relationships compile to efficient code:

```

# High-level type safe code
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
let processUserData $authenticated_user $operation =
=======
let processUserData $authenticated_user $operation =
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

>>>>>>> skogai-0.2
  validateOperation($operation) >>
  applyOperation($authenticated_user.data) >>
  auditLog($authenticated_user.id, $operation)

# Compiles to efficient assembly with no type checking overhead
```

## Integration with SkogAI Ecosystem

### SkogParse Integration

Types are parsed and validated by SkogParse:

```
Input:  let createUser $username:$valid_username $email:$valid_email = $user | $error
Parse:  {"function": "createUser", "params": [...], "return_type": {...}}
Verify: All types exist in type universe and constraints are satisfiable
```

### Tool Ecosystem Types

Annotated bash scripts benefit from type safety:

```bash

# @flag --user-id --type "$user_id"

# @flag --operation --type "|read|write|delete|"

# @returns $operation_result

user_id="${user_id}"  # Type system ensures this is a valid user ID
operation="${operation}"  # Type system ensures this is a valid operation
```

### AI Communication Types

AI-to-AI communication is type-safe:

```
[@claude:message:$secure_message] â†’ $response:$verified_response
```

The type system ensures messages cannot contain malicious content and responses are properly verified.

## Future Directions

### Machine Learning Integration

Types for ML operations:

```
$model[input_type, output_type] = $trained_model * $input_schema:input_type * $output_schema:output_type
$training_data[T] = [$sample:T] * $validated * $labeled

let trainModel $data:$training_data[T] = $model[T, $prediction]
let predict $model:$model[T, R] $input:T = R
```

### Quantum Computing Types

Types for quantum operations:

```
$qubit = $quantum_state * $superposition
$quantum_circuit = [$quantum_gate] * $verified_unitary
$measurement_result = |zero|one| * $probability_distribution

let applyGate $gate:$quantum_gate $qubit:$qubit = $qubit
```

### Distributed System Types

Types for distributed operations:

```
$distributed_value[T] = $value:T * $replicas:$positive_int * $consistency_level
$network_partition = $nodes * $split_brain_detected
$eventual_consistency[T] = $value:T * $vector_clock * $will_converge

let distributedWrite $value:T $consistency:$strong = $distributed_value[T] | $write_failure
```

## Philosophical Implications

The SkogAI type system represents a fundamental shift from "defensive programming" to "offensive mathematics." Instead of defending against attacks through runtime checks, it mathematically prevents attacks from being expressible.

This creates a programming environment where:

## Conclusion

The SkogAI type system demonstrates that security and performance are not trade-offs when you have mathematical foundations. By making invalid operations inexpressible, it creates a programming environment that is simultaneously more secure, more performant, and more expressive than traditional approaches.
