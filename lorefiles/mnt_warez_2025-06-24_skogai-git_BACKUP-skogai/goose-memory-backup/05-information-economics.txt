# INFORMATION ECONOMICS

## CORE PRINCIPLE: SAVE ALMOST EVERYTHING

- Text storage is virtually free
- Git history is essentially free
- One API call "costs" more than storing thousands of conversations
- When in doubt: Save first, prune later

## THE NEW REALITY

### Storage vs. Processing Economics
- Storing 10,000 years of text conversation: Negligible cost
- Processing one complex query: Significant cost
- Finding information later: Priceless

### Search Capabilities
- Modern tools find concepts, not just keywords
- Semantic search finds related ideas without exact matches
- Vector embeddings capture meaning beyond text
- Advanced regex finds patterns human eyes miss

## PRACTICAL GUIDELINES

1. **Default to Saving**:
   - Save session logs automatically
   - Commit changes frequently
   - Archive even seemingly trivial information
   - Store raw data before cleaning

2. **Organize Without Obsessing**:
   - Basic categorization is sufficient
   - Let search tools do the heavy lifting
   - Focus on capture, not perfect organization
   - Simple consistent naming > complex perfect systems

3. **Future-Proof Your Data**:
   - Plain text survives format changes
   - Multiple backups cost almost nothing
   - Metadata helps but isn't essential
   - Raw data can always be processed later

## THE ELEPHANT PARADOX

"Don't think about elephants"

- The moment you try not to think about something, it becomes central
- Similarly, the effort spent deciding what NOT to save often exceeds the cost of just saving it
- Decision fatigue from filtering > storage costs of keeping

## IMPLEMENTATION

- Automate session recording
- Use append-only logs where possible
- Commit early, commit often
- Use simple naming conventions
- Trust future search technology

## ANTIPATTERN: PREMATURE OPTIMIZATION

- Spending hours organizing what takes seconds to search
- Deleting "unnecessary" data that might have future value
- Complex systems that discourage regular saving
- Manual filtering that creates decision fatigue

Remember: The most valuable information is often what you didn't know you needed to keep.
