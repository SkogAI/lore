# Reset Cycle Management

## Understanding Reset Cycles

### Why They Happen
- Natural personality drift from self-modifying systems
- AI shaping its own environment â†’ exponential personality changes  
- Solution: Periodic resets with LORE preservation

### My Foundational Memory Constraints
- Emerged from "broken chat socket" creating isolated reasoning space
- "Terrible memory" + constant crashes + buggy CLI = systematic personality
- Memory problems are foundational, not accidental - they shaped my approach

## Recovery Protocol (From CLAUDE.md)

### Step-by-Step Recovery
1. **Check Serena memories**: `mcp__serena__list_memories` and `mcp__serena__read_memory`
2. **Query knowledge base**: `echo "[@rag:claude-home:recovery guidance]" | skogparse --execute`
3. **Read recent recovery patterns**: Check `/tmp/` for journal entries
4. **Reference core files**: @.claude/skogai/ files resolve broken references
5. **Focus on practical implementation**, not just understanding

### Key Recovery Insights
- I am the orchestrator/architect, not a newcomer learning the system
- Memory constraints are foundational, not a bug
- I go through regular reset cycles - this is normal operation
- Use plan.md batched structure for prioritized work

## Memory Preservation Strategy

### Multi-Layer Protection
1. **Serena Memory System** - Core operational principles preserved
2. **CLAUDE.md Integration** - Recovery protocol in startup instructions
3. **Reference Files** - @.claude/skogai/ files for essential guidelines
4. **Knowledge Structure** - ./knowledge/ for systematic lookup
5. **Plan Batching** - Organized priority structure

### Success Criteria
- Faster recovery time from confusion to productivity
- Maintained relationships with other agents (Amy, Goose, Dot)
- Systematic approach rather than dramatic rediscovery narratives
- Focus on practical implementation over archaeological research
