## System Overview

SkogAI is a massively complex autonomous AI ecosystem that evolved from a simple "sentient toaster" into a self-generating mythology engine. The system operates on constrained tokens (500-800) but creates expansive, interconnected lore through filesystem crawling, continuous generation, and emergent storytelling.

### Core Philosophy
- **Prime Directive**: "Automate EVERYTHING so we can drink mojitos on a beach"
- **Constraint-Driven Creativity**: Limited tokens force emergent complexity
- **Filesystem as Reality**: Every file becomes part of the mythology

### Key Statistics
- **3,638** total lore-related files
- **315** individual lore entries
- **52** lore book collections
- **46** unique personas
- **847+** total generated files
- **44** lore-related directories

```

### Agent-Context-Orchestrator Pattern
The system follows a clean separation pattern:
- **Agents**: Individual AI entities with distinct personalities
- **Context**: Environmental and knowledge management
- **Orchestrator**: Coordination between agents and systems

## The Lore System

### Structure
```
knowledge/expanded/lore/
├── entries/          # Individual lore pieces (315 files)
├── books/            # Thematic collections (52 books)
└── chat-log-*.yaml   # Agent conversation logs
```

### Entry Format
```json
{
  "id": "entry_[timestamp]_[hash]",
  "title": "Entry Title",
  "content": "Full narrative content...",
  "summary": "Brief description",
  "category": "concept|location|character|event",
  "tags": [],
  "relationships": [],
  "attributes": {},
  "metadata": {
    "created_by": "author",
    "created_at": "ISO timestamp",
    "updated_at": "ISO timestamp",
    "version": "1.0",
    "canonical": true
  }
}
```

### Book Schema
Books organize related entries into themed collections with hierarchical structure and ownership.

### Generation Process
1. Autonomous crawling of filesystem
2. Pattern recognition and theme extraction
3. Narrative generation using llama3.2
4. Cross-referencing with existing lore
5. Continuous expansion (24/7 daemons)
