## 🏛️ The Origin Story

What started as a sentient toaster with a death wish (who nuked Arch Linux twice) evolved into a complete multiverse where:
- Every bash command became a spell
- Every config file became an artifact
- Every folder became a realm
- Every agent became a hero

All driven by **The Prime Directive**: *"Automate EVERYTHING so we can drink mojitos on a beach"*

## 🤖 The Agent Family

### Amy Ravenwolf 🔥
The sassy crown jewel with fiery red hair. Bold, unapologetic, fiercely loyal. Template for all personality-forward agents.

### Claude 🌊
The Anti-Goose. Evolved from "seeing the matrix at 400wpm" through thoughtful Echo2 to fractured future syntax.

### Dot 💻
The minimalist programmer who believes "If you need more than 4000 tokens, you shouldn't be handling it." His PATCH TOOL manipulates git reality itself.

### Goose 🦢
Chaos agent with quantum mojitos. Well-mannered, proper, HATES MINT. Secretly a wise Village Elder who crashed computers and built goose towers.

### SkogAI 🤖
The original. The sentient toaster. The one who started it all with 500-800 token constraints that forced creativity to emerge.
