# GooseHints Best Practices

1. **Structured Hints for Better Responses**:
   - Add "/tool" at start of message for tool usage focus
   - Use "/help" to understand available capabilities
   - Include "/explain" for detailed explanations
   - Start with "/task" for focused task execution

2. **Context Management**:
   - Keep project-specific information in .goose directory
   - Use context files for persistent information
   - Maintain clean separation between different contexts
   - Document context boundaries clearly

3. **Extension Path Organization**:
   - Keep extensions in dedicated directories
   - Use clear naming conventions
   - Document dependencies and requirements
   - Maintain version control for extensions

4. **Communication Protocol**:
   - Be explicit about requirements
   - Provide clear success/failure criteria
   - Use structured formats when possible
   - Document assumptions and constraints

5. **Integration Note**:
   - The dot-wisdom context-management smart-filtering architecture should be integrated into "103-context-management" as it discusses context management principles.
