The Guardian's Tale

Riven stood at the edge of the Whispering Vale, his weathered cloak fluttering in the cool breeze that always seemed to flow from the ancient forest. Fifty years he had served as Guardian of the Eastern Threshold, and still the mysterious ways of the Vale filled him with wonder.

"Apprentice," he called over his shoulder, "bring the lantern. The sun fades and the mist rises."

Young Elysia hurried forward, her silver-trimmed robes marking her as a student of the Arcane Academy. At just sixteen, she possessed remarkable talent with elemental magic, though her impulsiveness often led to trouble.

"Master Riven," she asked, holding the enchanted blue flame high, "why do we patrol the border every solstice? The Boundary Stones have stood for centuries without failing."

Riven's eyes narrowed as he gazed into the deepening shadows beneath the massive oaks and twisted willows. "The Stones are powerful, yes, but they are not infallible. Especially now, when the veil between realms grows thin."

He knelt beside one of the ancient markers—a towering monolith of black stone etched with silver runes that glowed faintly in the gathering darkness. Removing a small crystal vial from his belt, he sprinkled silvery dust in a careful pattern around its base.

"The Fae Court grows restless of late," he continued. "Queen Lysindra seeks to expand her realm beyond the ancient treaties. The Council of Mages would be wise to heed my warnings."

Elysia frowned. "The Academy masters say the Fae are mere legends—old stories to frighten children."

Riven's laughter was without humor. "The Academy grows more arrogant with each passing generation. What they dismiss as legend, I have faced in battle." He pulled back his sleeve to reveal a spiraling scar that shimmered with an unnatural blue light. "The touch of Faewood magic never truly heals."

A sudden wind gusted through the trees, carrying with it the sound of distant bells and ethereal laughter. Riven tensed, drawing his silver-bladed staff from his back in one fluid motion. "Stay behind me," he commanded, his voice dropping to a whisper. "And whatever you do, speak no promises and accept no gifts."

The air before them shimmered, and the scent of wildflowers and ozone filled the clearing. Elysia gasped as a figure stepped from nothingness—a tall woman with skin like polished amber and hair the color of autumn leaves. Her eyes, pupilless and golden, regarded them with ancient intelligence.

"Guardian Riven," the woman spoke, her voice musical and strange. "Twice a hundred seasons have passed since you took up your watch. Your dedication is... noted."

"Lady Virelda," Riven replied with a formal nod, though his grip on his staff never loosened. "The terms of the Concordat remain unchanged. Your kind may not cross the threshold."

The Fae noble's smile revealed teeth too sharp to be human. "Circumstances change, Guardian. The balance shifts. My Queen extends an invitation to parley at the Moonwell tomorrow eve." She cast a curious glance at Elysia. "Bring your apprentice. Fresh eyes may see what old ones cannot."

Before Riven could respond, Virelda dissolved into a swirl of golden leaves that scattered in the wind. For several long moments, silence hung heavy in the glade.

"What just happened?" Elysia finally whispered, her eyes wide.

Riven sighed deeply, suddenly looking every one of his seventy years. "Politics, child. The most dangerous magic of all."
