#### The Forest Glade
A protected sanctuary within the corrupted forest

The Forest Glade is a haven of safety warded with ancient magic. No foul beast may enter, nor any with ill intent. While Eldoria was once a place of wonder, since the Shadowfangs came darkness reigns. Their evil cannot penetrate the glade though â€” its magic protects all within. Those who find the glade need not fear the night, for guardians keep watch till dawn.
