KEY FACTS:

* Air balloons use the principle of buoyancy, which states that an object less dense than its surroundings will float or rise.
* The primary force responsible for lifting an air balloon is the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the balloon, created by the difference in temperature and air pressure.
* The shape and size of the balloon can affect its ability to lift off the ground and maintain altitude.

MAIN CONCEPTS:

* **Buoyancy**: The upward force exerted on an object that is less dense than its surroundings, causing it to float or rise. (Definition)
* **Thermodynamics**: The study of heat, temperature, and energy transfer, which plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of air balloons.

RELATIONSHIPS:

* Buoyancy is directly related to thermodynamics, as the pressure difference created by temperature gradients is essential for lifting an air balloon.
* The shape and size of the balloon are also influenced by thermodynamic principles, such as the ideal gas law, which describes the relationship between pressure, volume, and temperature.
