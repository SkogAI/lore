KEY FACTS:

* Reinforcement learning (RL) was first introduced in the 1980s by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.
* Early RL algorithms were used in robotics for simple tasks such as robotic arm control and obstacle avoidance.
* In the 2000s, RL began to be applied to more complex tasks, including humanoid robot control and manipulation of objects.

MAIN CONCEPTS:

* Reinforcement learning: A type of machine learning where an agent learns to take actions in an environment by trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for its performance.
* Embodied AI: The integration of AI with robots and other physical systems, allowing them to interact with and learn from their environment.

RELATIONSHIPS:

* Reinforcement learning relates to embodied AI as it is a key component of many embodied AI systems. RL allows these systems to learn through interaction with their environment, enabling adaptation and improvement over time.
* Other important relationships include the connection between RL and imitation learning (IL), which involves learning from demonstrations rather than through trial and error.

POTENTIAL SECTIONS:

* Historical Development: A detailed look at the evolution of RL in robotics, including key milestones and breakthroughs.
