KEY FACTS:

* In the early 2000s, researchers started exploring reinforcement learning (RL) for robotic applications, initially using simple algorithms like Q-learning and SARSA.
* By the mid-2010s, RL had become a popular area of research in robotics, with the introduction of more advanced techniques like deep Q-networks (DQN) and policy gradients.
* Today, embodied AI, which combines RL with computer vision and sensorimotor integration, is revolutionizing robotics by enabling robots to learn complex tasks through experience.

MAIN CONCEPTS:

* Reinforcement Learning (RL): A subfield of machine learning that focuses on training agents to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
* Embodied AI: A research area that combines RL with computer vision, sensorimotor integration, and other AI techniques to enable robots to learn complex tasks through experience.

RELATIONSHIPS:

* RL is a crucial component of embodied AI, allowing robots to learn from their interactions with the environment and adapt to new situations.
* The evolution of RL in robotics has been driven by advances in computer vision, sensorimotor integration, and other AI techniques, which have enabled robots to better understand their environment and make more informed decisions.
