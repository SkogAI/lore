### Legacy Character Creation Documentation (2024)

These files describe an older approach to character creation using PLists and lorebook systems that predates the current shell-based implementation:

- **skogai-character-guide.md** - Original character creation guide
- **skogai-creation-guid.md** - Character creation process documentation (note: typo in original filename preserved)
- **skogai-lorebook-system.md** - Lorebook system documentation

**Note**: Current implementation uses shell tools as the primary approach. These files are retained for historical context only.
