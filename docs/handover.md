# Session Handover Notes

## Session: 2025-09-25

### What Was Accomplished
- Created GitHub issue #4 about updating default branch references from 'main' to 'master'
- The issue addresses git command failures when referencing `origin/main` which doesn't exist
- Issue URL: https://github.com/SkogAI/lore/issues/4

### Context
The repository uses 'master' as the default branch, but some tooling/commands were expecting 'main', causing errors like:
```
fatal: ambiguous argument 'origin/main': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
```

### Next Steps
1. Update any configuration files that reference 'main' as the default branch
2. Review and update documentation that mentions the default branch
3. Update scripts or automation that assume 'main' as the default
