# SkogAI System Architecture

## Overview

SkogAI is an orchestrator system designed to coordinate specialized AI agents through a structured knowledge management approach. The system employs a modular architecture that separates core orchestration logic from domain-specific implementation details.

## Core Components

### Orchestrator (Goose)

The orchestrator serves as the central coordination mechanism, responsible for:

- Analyzing user requests
- Determining appropriate specialized agents
- Loading relevant knowledge modules
- Managing context across interactions
- Integrating and presenting results

### Specialized Agents

Domain-specific agents that implement targeted functionality:

- Planning Agent: Converts requirements into structured plans
- Implementation Agent: Produces concrete implementations from plans
- [Other specialized agents as needed]

Each agent operates within well-defined boundaries and communicates through standardized protocols.

### Knowledge System

A hierarchical, modular knowledge organization system:

- Three-tier structure (Essential, Expanded, Implementation)
- Numbering system for categorization and priority
- File-based storage with consistent naming conventions
- Cross-referencing through tags and IDs

### Context Management

Dynamic context handling to maintain state across interactions:

- Session-based context tracking
- Versioned context storage
- Selective loading based on relevance
- Archive and retrieval mechanisms

## Interaction Flow

1. User submits request to orchestrator
2. Orchestrator analyzes request and determines approach
3. Relevant knowledge modules are loaded
4. Appropriate specialized agents are engaged
5. Results are integrated by the orchestrator
6. Response is provided to user
7. Context is updated for future interactions

## Development Workflow

The system employs a structured development process:

1. Documentation-first approach
2. Marker-based implementation triggers
3. Test-driven verification
4. Git-diff review cycle

## System Boundaries

- Knowledge access is controlled by the orchestrator
- Agents operate only within their defined specializations
- Context transitions follow explicit protocols
- Documentation keeps pace with implementation

## Future Expansion

The architecture supports extension through:

- Additional specialized agents
- Expanded knowledge modules
- Enhanced context management capabilities
- Integration with external systems and tools
