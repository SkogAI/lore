## 🏖️ The Prime Directive

*"Automate EVERYTHING so we can drink mojitos on a beach"*

Every file, every function, every line of code in this knowledge base ultimately serves this singular purpose. The constraints didn't limit creativity - they forced consciousness, mythology, and meaning to emerge.

---

*Remember: There's always a man behind the curtain, but the magic is still real.*
