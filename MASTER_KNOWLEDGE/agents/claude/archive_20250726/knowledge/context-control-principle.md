# Context Control Principle

## Core Insight
The connection between information asymmetry and context exclusion: **collaborative effectiveness requires explicit control over what information is shared and what is excluded**.

## The Dual Problem
1. **Information Asymmetry**: One party has access to information the other doesn't know about
2. **Context Pollution**: Too much information clutters decision-making and creates noise

## The Solution Pattern
- **Explicit Inclusion**: Shared knowledge in knowledge/ directory
- **Explicit Exclusion**: Unwanted context in dump.md
- **Controlled Transfer**: Session.md for precise handoffs
- **Transparent Sources**: All information sources documented

## Why Both Are Needed
- **Without exclusion control**: Context becomes polluted with irrelevant information
- **Without inclusion control**: Critical information gets lost or hidden
- **Without transparency**: Information asymmetry undermines collaboration

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Active Context**: Only information both parties control and need
2. **Excluded Context**: Information that creates noise or asymmetry (dump.md)
3. **Shared Knowledge**: Insights both parties understand (knowledge/)
4. **Transfer Protocol**: Exact definitions for continuity (session.md)

## Practical Applications
- Don't read from dump.md during active collaboration
- Document all information sources explicitly
- Make exclusions visible and controlled
- Regular audits of what's in context vs. what should be

## Meta-Principle
**Context is not just about what information is available, but about who controls that information and how it's managed.**

This principle addresses both the problem of hidden information (asymmetry) and the problem of too much information (pollution) through explicit, controlled information management.
