## MEMORY NUMBERING PROTOCOL

### For Numbered Categories:

```
## STORE IN MEMORY

CATEGORY: [number]-[name]
NUMBERED: yes
ACTION: [append/replace/review]
TAGS: [tag1, tag2]
GLOBAL: [yes/no]

---

[Information content here]

---

Store according to ACTION instruction. If ACTION is "review", store but flag for discussion.
```

### For Non-Numbered Categories:

```
## STORE IN MEMORY

CATEGORY: [descriptive-name]
NUMBERED: no
TAGS: [tag1, tag2]
GLOBAL: [yes/no]

---

[Information content here]

---

Store normally. No numbering required.
```

### Numbering Rules:

1. **Reserved Numbers (00-99)**:
   - Only modified through explicit joint review
   - Require verification before replacement
   - Append-only unless specifically instructed otherwise

2. **Higher Numbers (100+)**:
   - More flexible, but still require the ACTION parameter
   - Can be created more freely for specialized knowledge

3. **Similar Category Detection**:
   - If content is submitted without numbering but matches an existing numbered category
   - Store temporarily with flag: "POTENTIAL-MATCH-FOR-[existing-number-category]"
   - Keep for discussion in next interaction

This system protects critical numbered memories while allowing flexibility for other information, and provides a mechanism to identify potential matches without immediately overwriting existing content.
