# GitHub Workflow Toggle Configuration
# ====================================
# This file controls which optional workflows are enabled.
# Set a workflow to `true` to enable it, `false` to disable it.
#
# Usage: Each workflow checks this config file at runtime.
# If disabled, the workflow will skip execution gracefully.
#
# To modify: Edit this file and commit to master branch.
# Changes take effect on the next workflow trigger.

  # Claude AI Integration Workflows
