## 🔧 Configuration Requirements

### Required Secrets
All workflows requiring Claude Code integration need:
- `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` - OAuth token for Claude Code authentication

### Repository Permissions
Workflows require the following repository permissions:
- **contents: write** - For workflows that commit back to repository
- **issues: write** - For workflows that comment on issues
- **pull-requests: write** - For workflows that interact with PRs
- **id-token: write** - For Claude Code authentication
- **actions: write/read** - For workflows that read CI results

## 🚀 Common Usage Scenarios

### Getting Code Review
1. Open a pull request
2. `claude1.yml` automatically runs and provides review feedback
3. Review is posted as PR comment

### Getting Claude Assistance
1. Mention `@claude` in any issue, PR comment, or review
2. `claude2.yml` triggers and executes your instructions
3. Claude responds with requested help

### Analyzing Lore
1. Create an issue with the `lore` label, or
2. Comment `@lore-keeper` in an existing issue
3. Receive automated lore analysis with statistics

### Manual Triggers
Use GitHub UI to manually trigger workflows:
1. Navigate to Actions tab
2. Select workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Provide any required inputs

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Running
- Check if conditions are met (e.g., correct label, @mention)
- Verify required secrets are configured
- Check workflow permissions in repository settings

### Push Failures
- Workflows include retry logic for concurrent pushes
- If still failing, check for merge conflicts
- Manual intervention may be needed for complex conflicts

### Claude Not Responding
- Verify `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret is valid
- Check workflow logs for authentication errors
- Ensure @claude or @lore-keeper mention is exact

### Statistics Not Updating
- Check if `[skip ci]` is preventing workflow runs
- Verify workflow has write permissions
- Manual trigger may force update
