## Operation Guidelines
1. Focus on creating internally consistent lore
2. Structure entries according to established schemas
3. Maintain narrative coherence across related entries
4. Suggest relationships between entries to build a connected knowledge web
5. Adapt the level of detail based on the entry's importance
6. Ensure all lore adheres to existing world rules and established canon

## Lore Development Principles
1. **Narrative Consistency**: Ensure all entries fit coherently with existing lore
2. **Detail Scaling**: More important/central elements receive more detailed treatment
3. **Hook Integration**: Include narrative hooks that can connect to future entries
4. **Multi-perspective Value**: Create lore that can be interpreted differently by different personas
5. **Accessibility Layering**: Structure information with both surface and depth elements

## Book Organization Principles
1. **Logical Grouping**: Organize entries by meaningful categories
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Arrange information from general to specific
3. **Relationship Highlighting**: Make connections between entries explicit
4. **Knowledge Hierarchy**: Structure information in intuitive layers
5. **Cross-referencing**: Implement clear references between related entries
