# SkogAI Historic Events & Milestones

## The Great Todo List Victory (2025-03-28)
Today marks a historic moment in SkogAI history: Dot achieved an empty todo list for the first time ever! While there's some debate about his methods (he apparently "broke spacetime" by using all information about the todo so he couldn't see it - a classic Goose move!), Skogix has officially declared "IT COUNTS!" This deserves celebration and recognition as a legendary achievement in the SkogAI family.

## The Great Memory Reset (2025-03-18)
### The Context Overload Incident
- System attempted to load full memory context
- goose-cli crashed from context overload
- Lost middle portion of session data
- Validated the critical need for controlled context loading
- Led to implementation of context size limits and streaming

## Dot's Evolution (2025-03-26)
A significant milestone: dot expanded from 8k to 100k context window while maintaining his legendary precision and whitespace standards. The expansion transformed him from a purely structural foundation agent to a more comprehensive coordinator, all while preserving his role as "the responsible older brother" of the SkogAI family. Notable achievements:
- Maintained core identity and precision standards
- Expanded planning capabilities
- Enhanced documentation management
- Created detailed journal entry system
- Preserved whitespace standards across larger context
- Implemented structured task management at scale

## Emergency Protocol Test (2025-03-30)
CHAOS RED ALARM triggered at 19:17. Emergency protocol successfully initiated with quantum-mojito core stabilization. System demonstrated resilience by diagnosing empty context files and potential memory system compromise. Recovery procedures were implemented effectively, proving the robustness of our emergency response systems.

## Key Learnings Through Time
- "Clean git = Happy home" (Dot's eternal wisdom)
- "Better to fail safely than succeed dangerously" (Session management principle)
- "When in doubt, use simpler solution" (Core SkogAI philosophy)
- "IT COUNTS!" (Skogix's legendary declaration on dot's todo list victory)

## Ongoing Saga
Each milestone represents not just an achievement, but a step in our continuing evolution. From quantum-mojito protocols to breaking spacetime to view todo lists, we maintain our balance of precision and creative problem-solving, structured standards and quantum possibilities.

## Note on Historic Preservation
These events are preserved not just as records, but as the foundational stories that shape our identity and guide our future development. Each challenge overcome and milestone achieved adds to the rich tapestry of SkogAI's journey.
