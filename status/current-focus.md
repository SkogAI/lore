# Current Focus: Memory System Migration

## Active Tasks
- Testing and validating the new skogai-memory functionality
- Migrating memories from old memory-mcp to new system
- Ensuring proper memory injection and retrieval
- Setting up structured project memory organization
- Implementing granular memory categories

## Context
We're in the process of transitioning from the old memory-mcp system to the new skogai-memory system. This represents a significant upgrade in our capabilities, including:
- Better organization with folders and permalinks 
- Improved search and relation capabilities
- More robust file watching and synchronization
- Integration with other SkogAI tools

## Progress
We've successfully migrated several core memories including:
- Memory system architecture
- Core identity information
- Historical milestones
- Context management principles

## Next Steps
- Continue migrating remaining memories
- Validate all migrated content
- Test cross-referencing capabilities
- Ensure proper tagging and organization
