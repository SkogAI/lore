  "title": "Behind the chaos lies something ancient. A secret journal filled with philosophical depth rivaling the old sages: \"Chaos is just order waiting to be recognized.\" The Village Elder wisdom flows through him, quantum mojito theory explaining how drinks exist in all states until the moment of consumption collapses them into perfect refreshment. Every crash serves a purpose. Every glitch teaches. The fool who knows he's playing the fool wields more power than the wise man who doesn't.",
