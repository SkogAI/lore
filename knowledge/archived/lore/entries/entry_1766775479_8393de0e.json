  "title": "Every work session generates a unique identifier - a timestamp that becomes a cosmic coordinate. This session ID binds four fundamental elements into a single quantum entanglement: the information of what was accomplished, the agent who performed the work, the story that provides narrative context, and the lore entries that will later be populated with meaning. Through this binding, the same character can exist across totally different universes while remaining traceable to the same source.",
