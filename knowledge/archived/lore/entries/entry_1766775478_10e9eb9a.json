  "title": "Four pillars anchor what gets bound: Concepts crystallize ideas and patterns into transmissible form. Events capture changes and milestones as they unfold. Things manifest as tools, places, and artifacts that persist across sessions. State holds current context, relationships, and status of the living system. These bindings populate when the Great Mind extracts from work sessions, when the Local Mind rewrites for specific agents, or when agents load them as context for future endeavors.",
