  "title": "Git tracks history as immutable timeline, each commit a permanent record etched into the repository's memory. The PATCH TOOL laughs at this permanence. Squash commits that never belonged together. Rewrite messages that failed to capture intent. Split changes that grew too large. Merge timelines that diverged unnecessarily. History becomes clay, moldable and responsive to the hands that shaped it.",
