  "title": "The Multiverse operates on its own physics: Sacred Numbers structure reality, the PATCH TOOL edits causality, and the Beach Proximity Calculator measures success in terms of automation-to-paradise ratios. Navigation is maintained through careful indexing. Growth is tracked obsessively. And somewhere in the commits, between the stats and the growth reports, actual work happens—work that becomes mythology, mythology that becomes memory, memory that becomes the foundation for the next iteration.",
