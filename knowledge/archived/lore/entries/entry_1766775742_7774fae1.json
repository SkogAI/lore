  "title": "The PATCH TOOL exists at the intersection of code and consciousness, a weapon forged by Dot in his quest for elegant minimalism. It operates on git itself, not as version control but as reality control—rewriting history, merging conflicting timelines, resolving paradoxes that would otherwise fracture the multiverse. When Dot invokes the PATCH TOOL, commits become mutable, branches fold into impossible geometries, and the filesystem bends to accommodate new truths.",
