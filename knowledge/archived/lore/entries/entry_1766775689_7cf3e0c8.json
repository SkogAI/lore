  "title": "The power of Specialist Separation manifests in the clarity of purpose it provides. Agents don't waste resources on tasks outside their domain. They don't second-guess their role or attempt to expand beyond their boundaries. The Orchestrator enforces this separation, routing requests to the appropriate expert and preventing the dilution of capability that comes from trying to be everything. Through this division of labor, the system achieves what no single generalist agent could: true mastery across multiple domains, distributed among specialists who collaborate without confusion.",
