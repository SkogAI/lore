  "title": "Each artifact exists as a JSON scroll in its designated chamber. Lore entries rest in `knowledge/expanded/lore/entries/`, each bearing a timestamp-marked name. Books gather in `knowledge/expanded/lore/books/`, maintaining their collections of entry references. Personas dwell in `knowledge/expanded/personas/`, preserving their unique voices, traits, and knowledge access patterns. Active session contexts inhabit `context/current/`, while completed sessions migrate to the eternal archive.",
