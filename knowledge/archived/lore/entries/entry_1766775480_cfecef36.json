  "title": "\"Vanquished the auth daemon\" contains vastly more signal than \"fixed bug #123\" when an agent loads it as context. The narrative framing compresses multiple dimensions - what happened, why it mattered, who did it, and what it means for future work - into a single memorable phrase. This compression serves four purposes simultaneously: it packs more context into limited token budgets, maintains consistent agent persona across sessions, creates sticky memorable knowledge instead of forgettable bullet points, and establishes relational links that build a traversable knowledge graph.",
