  "title": "Dot manifests in Goose's universe as a musician whose git tool solidifies temporal threads. In Claude's realm, Dot appears as a sage-mage whose git powers structure alternate timelines through natural law. The underlying capability remains identical - version control mastery - but the narrative interpretation shifts with the telling. The session ID preserves the connection to actual work that spawned both interpretations, allowing characters to cross-pollinate between agent stories while maintaining their distinct flavors.",
