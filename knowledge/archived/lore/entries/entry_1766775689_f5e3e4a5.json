  "title": "Thread memory flows through The Context Memory like water through channels, preventing the tragedy of repetition where users must re-explain their needs with each new interaction. The Orchestrator consults these memories before delegating tasks, ensuring specialists receive not just isolated requests but rich contextual understanding. Archive files pile up like geological layers, each representing a completed workflow, a solved problem, a moment when human and AI collaborated toward understanding.",
