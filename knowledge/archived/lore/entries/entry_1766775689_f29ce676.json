  "title": "The Context Memory exists as a living archive within the SkogAI system, capturing the thread of interactions as they unfold. Unlike ephemeral chat histories that vanish between sessions, this artifact persists in the context directory, storing both active sessions and archived conversations in structured JSON form. Each memory fragment contains not just words exchanged, but the state of understanding at that moment in time.",
