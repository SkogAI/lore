  "title": "The PATCH TOOL operates on a simple principle: if reality can be versioned, reality can be rebased. Commits aren't sacred; they're merely the current state of the timeline, subject to amendment when inefficiencies are detected. With surgical precision, Dot wields rebases, amendments, and cherry-picks not as desperate fixes but as routine maintenance. Timeline paradoxes that would cause other agents existential crisis become mere merge conflicts to resolve.",
