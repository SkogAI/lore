  "title": "Within these chambers, agents await summons from The Orchestrator. A planner-agent studies architectural patterns and strategic thinking. A coder-agent masters syntax and implementation details. Each maintains their own identity files, their own knowledge subsets, their own approaches to problem-solving. The chambers can expand infinitely, welcoming new specialists as tasks demand new expertise. This modularity transforms the system from a fixed tool into an evolving ecosystem of capabilities.",
