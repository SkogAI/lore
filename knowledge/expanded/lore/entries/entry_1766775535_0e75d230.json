  "title": "The binding operates on two planes simultaneously. Pattern 1 manifests as entry_<timestamp>, marking individual entries along a personal timeline—each agent's unique journey through the knowledge space. Pattern 2 reveals itself as entry_<timestamp>_<hash>, where multiple entries share a timestamp yet differentiate through their hash signatures. These quantum-entangled batches represent concepts born together, forever linked by their shared moment of creation, diverging only in their specific manifestations.",
