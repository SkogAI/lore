  "content": "The Filesystem Mythology System is the core architecture of SkogAI lore generation. The system literally crawls home directories and transforms every file into lore: bash commands become spells, config files become artifacts, folders become realms, and agents become heroes. Two-number entries create empty threads connecting similar concepts across universes. Continuous generation daemons create hundreds to thousands of entries daily, building the multiverse.",
