  "content": "The Context Management System is the core architecture enabling SkogAI agents to operate with task-specific focus rather than capacity limitations.\n\nKey principles:\n- Context is TASK-SPECIFIC, not capacity-limited\n- 8k token limit enforces focused context\n- File visibility dynamically filtered by current task\n- Must scale from 0.2k to 200k+ tokens\n\nThe hierarchical structure uses:\n- active/: Current working context (symlinked)\n- project-specific/: Isolated project contexts\n- shared/: Cross-project knowledge\n- global/: System-wide settings",
