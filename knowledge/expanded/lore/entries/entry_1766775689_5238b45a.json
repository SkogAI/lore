  "title": "This architecture prevents the degradation that comes from mixing critical and trivial, fundamental and implementation-specific. Each piece of knowledge knows its place, its number serving as both identifier and priority marker. Specialized agents traverse these chambers seeking only what they need, loading context with precision rather than drowning in irrelevance. The Library maintains an index at its entrance, a map to navigate the categorized depths where information awaits retrieval.",
