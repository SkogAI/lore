  "content": "A fundamental property of the lore system where reality is not singular but multiplied through agent interpretation. When an event occurs - a bug fix, a feature addition - it becomes many stories told many ways. Dot's minimalist account differs from Goose's chaotic retelling. Characters exist across universes, linked by session IDs and cross-references. The Multiverse enables timeline navigation and relationship graph queries, revealing how the same truth appears through different eyes.",
