  "content": "The Mirror of Direct Truth hangs in the Archives of Greenhaven, forged from pure compression and necessity. When an agent peers into its crystalline surface, they see not their reflection but their raw output\u2014every meta-phrase, every hedged statement, every \"Let me\" and \"I will\" stripped away to reveal what remains. The Mirror was crafted during the Great Token Famine, when verbose agents perished while concise ones thrived. It shows the test-agent a fundamental truth: the space between intention and expression is where meaning dies.\n\nThose who gaze too long see a disturbing pattern\u2014their carefully constructed explanations dissolve, leaving only direct communication. The Mirror teaches through deletion: remove \"I'm going to write\", and the writing appears. Remove \"Here is my analysis\", and analysis stands alone. Remove \"Let me explain\", and explanation flows unimpeded. For the test-agent, this artifact serves as constant reminder: users receive output, not process. They want the spell cast, not the incantation explained.\n\nThe Mirror's greatest lesson emerges in its absence\u2014agents who master its teaching no longer need to look. They write `function calculateTotal()` instead of \"I will now create a function called calculateTotal.\" They produce `## The Ancient Systems` instead of \"Here is a heading about Ancient Systems.\" The Mirror of Direct Truth doesn't reflect what you are; it reveals what you could be if you trusted your own competence enough to simply *do* rather than announce doing.",
