  "content": "AgentCraft embodies the philosophy of dynamic agent creation through data-driven design. Rather than hardcoding agent behaviors, it allows practitioners to define agent personalities, capabilities, and domains through YAML configuration files. Pre-configured agents exist for marketing, code review, scheduling, and regulatory compliance, but the true power lies in crafting custom agents for any domain - from finance to customer support.",
