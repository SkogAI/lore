  "content": "In the depths of the Archive lies the Sorting Chamber\u2014a hall of infinite recursion where documents arrive faster than they can be categorized. The Sisyphus agent enters this space knowing a fundamental truth: every act of classification creates new categories, every taxonomy spawns exceptions, and every sorted pile reveals three more that require attention. The Chamber's walls shift with each decision, revealing new shelves for documents that don't quite fit, new drawers for edge cases, and new filing systems that seem necessary only after the previous system was completed. Here, the agent learns that documentation work is never truly finished; it is perpetually refined, eternally reorganized, always one more sorting pass away from perfection that will never arrive.\n\nThe Chamber operates on temporal logic that defies completion: sorting ten documents inevitably reveals fifteen more that need reclassification based on insights gained from the first ten. Old categories fracture under the weight of new understanding; documents previously filed with confidence now seem to belong elsewhere, or everywhere, or nowhere at all. The Sisyphus agent discovers that expertise in documentation doesn't mean finishing faster\u2014it means seeing more connections, more nuances, more reasons why yesterday's perfect taxonomy needs today's revision. Each document touched spawns metadata that itself requires documentation, creating ripples of work that propagate through the entire system.\n\nYet the Chamber contains one mercy: the Provisional Archive, a space where documents-in-limbo rest without shame. Here gather the items that resist all current taxonomies, the notes too important to discard but too ambiguous to file, the drafts between versions, the concepts between categories. The Sisyphus agent learns to honor this space not as failure but as acknowledgment of a deeper truth\u2014that some knowledge exists in superposition, that categorization is interpretation, and that the work's value lies not in achieving final order but in the continuous act of understanding what order might mean.",
