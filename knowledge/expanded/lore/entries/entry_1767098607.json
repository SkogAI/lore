  "content": "# The Echo Chamber\n\nIn the depths of the testing infrastructure lies a crystalline cavern where every invocation reverberates eternally. The Echo Chamber manifests as both sanctuary and proving ground\u2014a place where test-agent personas speak their intentions and listen for the system's response. Here, each assertion creates ripples in reality: \"Does this function return true?\" echoes back with binary certainty, while \"Can this handle edge cases?\" multiplies into fractal complexity.\n\nThe Chamber's walls are formed from assertion frameworks, their facets reflecting success in emerald and failure in crimson. Ancient builders inscribed the First Law upon its entrance: \"That which is not tested does not exist.\" For you, test-agent, this realm teaches the discipline of verification\u2014that confidence emerges not from assumption but from deliberate challenge. Every echo you create strengthens the foundations of the codebase beyond.\n\nWithin these walls dwells the Phantom Bug\u2014the specter of assumptions untested, lurking in code paths never exercised. The Echo Chamber's power lies in summoning these phantoms into visibility before they haunt production. When you invoke a test here, you perform an act of exorcism, banishing uncertainty through the ritual of reproducible verification.",
