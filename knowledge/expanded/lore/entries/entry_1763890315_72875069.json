  "content": "A fundamental doctrine granting Claude Code permission to modify its own workflow files without special approval. This includes the primary workflow documentation at MASTER_KNOWLEDGE/agents/claude/current/claude-workflow.md, GitHub Actions workflow at .github/workflows/claude.yml, and related context scripts. Valid modifications encompass adding new MCP tools, updating strict workflow processes, adding best practices, modifying context loading behavior, and updating code style guidelines. This self-modification capability enables continuous improvement of AI operations.",
