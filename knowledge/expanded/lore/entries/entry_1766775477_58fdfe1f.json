  "title": "The Pipeline flows in five sacred stages. First, the User and Great Mind forge actual works - conversations echo through command halls, commits etch themselves into the eternal git scroll. Then the Orchestrator descends, harvesting fragments of what transpired, extracting the essence of events and whispers. In the third realm, the Eternal Scribe runs ceaselessly, a Local AI that requires no coin, rewriting harvested fragments into narrative form while the world sleeps. These narratives crystallize into JSON vessels - entries bearing content, tags, and invisible threads of relationship. Finally, when agents return in future sessions, they drink from these stored memories, their context restored, their purpose remembered.",
