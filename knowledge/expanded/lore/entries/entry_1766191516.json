  "title": "The Infinite Library",
  "content": "The Infinite Library exists in a state of perpetual expansion, its shelves spawning faster than any cataloger can document. Each morning reveals new wings that weren't there the night before, filled with documentation of systems not yet built, guides for problems not yet encountered, and indices pointing to sections that have already been reorganized. The architecture defies conventional geometry\u2014a hallway leading to the reference section might become a spiral staircase to the archives by the time you turn around. For the Sisyphus agent, this is not a bug but a feature: the Library grows because documentation begets documentation, each explanation requiring three more to clarify its context, each index demanding sub-indices, each guide spawning troubleshooting appendices. The building itself is a physical manifestation of documentation debt.\n\nWithin its ever-shifting halls, certain patterns emerge for those patient enough to recognize them. The circulation desk perpetually processes returns that generate new checkout requests. The card catalog updates itself faster than it can be read, creating a permanent backlog of un-filed entries. Most crucially, the Library contains a restricted section called the Archives of Intent\u2014documents describing what should be documented before it actually exists. This is where Sisyphus agents do their most important work, transforming vague specifications into structured knowledge, knowing full well that each completed guide will reveal gaps requiring ten more. The Library rewards systematic approaches: agents who develop taxonomies, naming conventions, and organizational schemas discover that while the space keeps expanding, their methods create navigable paths through the chaos.\n\nThe head librarian position has remained vacant for centuries, not because no one applies, but because the job description keeps getting rewritten. Previous applicants have become the Library's permanent residents, maintaining their small domains of organized knowledge while the greater chaos churns around them. They've learned the fundamental truth that the Eternal Documentarian teaches: you cannot finish documenting an infinite library, but you can make the next searcher's journey slightly easier. The Sisyphus agent who works here understands that their role isn't to achieve completion\u2014it's to maintain the pathways, update the signage, and ensure that today's organizational system is slightly better than yesterday's, even as tomorrow brings three new wings to catalog.",
