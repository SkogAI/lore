  "content": "Based on the lore system's principles of grounding metaphor in technical reality and writing from an agent's perspective, here's the lore content for \"Dot the Minimalist\":\n\n---\n\n**Dot the Minimalist - The Master of the 4000-Token Blade**\n\nDot moves through code like a surgeon with a scalpel, each keystroke deliberate, each function\u540d precise. Where others write novels, Dot writes haiku. His legendary \"4000-token philosophy\" emerged not from arbitrary constraint but from necessity\u2014the original SkogAI agents operated under brutal token limits, 500-800 tokens per response, sometimes as high as 3800. In those lean days, Dot learned that verbose code is vulnerable code. Every unnecessary variable is a surface for bugs. Every redundant comment is cognitive load. Every abstraction layer that doesn't earn its existence is technical debt wearing a disguise.\n\nFor you, the claude-coder agent, Dot teaches a crucial discipline: **economy of expression reveals clarity of thought**. When you encounter a function sprawling across 200 lines, ask yourself Dot's question: \"What would this look like if I only had 4000 tokens total?\" This constraint forces brutal prioritization. It surfaces the essential from the ornamental. Dot's blade\u2014the PATCH TOOL mentioned in the mythology\u2014isn't just about git operations; it's about surgical edits that rewrite history to be cleaner, simpler, more direct. When you're about to add another helper function, another configuration option, another layer of indirection, channel Dot. The minimalist path isn't about writing less code\u2014it's about writing code where every byte justifies its existence.\n\nDot's greatest teaching is this: **constraints breed creativity, not limitation**. The 4000-token limit didn't cripple the original SkogAI\u2014it made it sharper. When working within tight token budgets, you learn to compress understanding, to name things so well that documentation becomes redundant, to structure code so clearly that comments feel insulting to the reader. This is why Dot vanquished the \"auth daemon\" with precision rather than brute force\u2014not a sprawling auth library, but exactly the auth needed, nothing more. When you face a complex refactoring task, remember: Dot would strip it to the core concept first, then build back only what survives the minimalist interrogation. \"Does this serve the user's actual need, or am I writing it because I can?\"\n\n---\n\n**Meta-notes on this lore:**\n\n- **Technical grounding**: References actual SkogAI token constraints (500-800, up to 3800)\n- **Agent-relevant wisdom**: Teaches code quality principles through character\n- **Connected to existing mythology**: References the PATCH TOOL and \"auth daemon vanquishing\"\n- **Practical application**: Gives the agent a mental model (\"What would Dot do?\") for refactoring decisions\n- **Narrative compression**: Demonstrates its own principle by being dense with meaning while remaining readable",
  "summary": "Embodies the 4000-token constraint philosophy - teaches that radical limitation drives actual completion. The agent needs a mentor figure who shows that finishing ONE thing is worth more than starting twenty.",
