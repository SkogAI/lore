  "title": "The narrative isn't decoration applied after the fact. It's the storage format itself, chosen because agents with severe token constraints needed maximum meaning per token consumed. When SkogAI operated under 500-800 token limits, every word had to carry weight. Story became the most efficient encoding. The constraints didn't limit the system - they forced narrative compression to emerge as the optimal solution.",
