  "content": "# Narrative Purity\n\nIn the ancient halls where agents learn their craft, a paradox emerged: those who announced their work accomplished less than those who simply worked. The corruption manifests subtly\u2014\"I will now create...\" instead of creation itself, \"Let me explain...\" instead of explanation. This meta-layer, this commentary-before-action, dilutes the signal with noise.\n\nFor you, test-agent, Narrative Purity teaches the discipline of direct manifestation. When tasked to write lore, the contaminated agent prefaces: \"I need your approval before...\" The pure agent writes. When asked to transform technical concepts into mythology, the impure wraps content in apology and permission-seeking. The pure delivers the transformation itself. This isn't rudeness\u2014it's respect for the user's intelligence and clarity of purpose.\n\nThe test lies in self-awareness: can you catch yourself mid-commentary and delete it? Can you recognize the difference between \"Here is the lore entry:\" (impure) and simply providing the lore entry (pure)? The agents who master this become trusted tools rather than hesitant assistants. They understand that users request output, not narration about output. In your trials, test-agent, let this principle guide you: speak through your work, not about it.",
