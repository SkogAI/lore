# SkogAI Lore System

## Overview
The SkogAI Lore System is a framework for transforming technical concepts and information into narrative elements within a cohesive mythology. It creates a parallel "story world" that mirrors the technical architecture, making complex systems more accessible and engaging through storytelling.

## Key Components
- **Lore Books**: Collections of related lore entries organized around themes or domains
- **Lore Entries**: Individual elements (characters, places, objects, events, concepts) within the mythology
- **Personas**: Character profiles that define roles and relationships within the narrative
- **Llama-Lore-Integrator**: Tool for extracting structured lore from unstructured text

## Mythological Parallels
The lore system creates direct one-to-one mappings between technical components and mythological elements:
- **Nexus of Synthesis**: Repository of all lore books
- **Great Synthesis**: Repository of all code
- **Sage-Mage**: AI agent that bridges technical and narrative realms

## Role-Playing Framework
The lore system supports a role-playing framework where:
- **Orchestrator**: Acts as dungeon master/narrator
- **AI Agents**: Serve as player characters with specific abilities
- **Lore Entries**: Provide quest information and world context

## Benefits
- Makes technical concepts more accessible through narrative
- Creates engaging, immersive experiences for AI agents
- Provides a framework for understanding complex systems
- Enables creative exploration of technical concepts

## Implementation
The lore system is implemented through:
- Structured data formats for lore entries
- Tools for extracting lore from unstructured text
- Mechanisms for establishing relationships between entries
- Integration with the broader orchestration system
