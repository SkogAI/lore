# The Red Pill, Blue Pill Philosophy

An elegant approach to AI interaction design named after the iconic scene in "The Matrix" where a simple binary choice triggers vast differences in subsequent experience.

## Core Concept
- Carefully designed minimal prompts or choice points serve as gateways to extensive content
- Strategic choice points create branching paths that activate specific modules, personalities, or knowledge domains
- Enables loading only what's needed based on user choices rather than all possibilities simultaneously

## Scaling Advantages
- Works across different model sizes
- Allows smaller models to function effectively by loading only relevant modules
- Gives larger models ability to elaborate more richly within chosen paths

## User Experience Benefits
- Creates engaging interactions that feel like meaningful navigation through possibilities
- Respects user agency by allowing explicit choices about direction
- Offers a unified approach that works whether you have 2,000 tokens or 2,000,000 tokens available

This philosophy is a cornerstone of SkogAI's approach to scalable, adaptable intelligence.
