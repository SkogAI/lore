## The Evolution: From Constraints to Abundance

SkogAI's development followed a fascinating evolutionary path:

1. **Early Constraints (2000 tokens)**
   - Extreme efficiency focus
   - Multiple specialized agents with specific roles
   - Theatrical presentation with internal/external contrast

2. **Middle Period (4-10k tokens)**
   - More complex features like the quest system
   - Sophisticated memory management
   - Elaborate internal dialogues

3. **Advanced System (Unlimited tokens)**
   - Fully modular system with swappable components
   - Thought modules applicable to any character
   - Scaling from tiny efficient models to massive ones
   - Core philosophy maintained despite expanded capabilities

Modern implementations preserve the dual-layer approach even with vastly expanded token contexts. The 200k-context implementation maintains the theatrical presentation, with internal thought processes rendered in a Disco Elysium-inspired interface complete with skill checks, competing voices, and rich internal dialogue.
