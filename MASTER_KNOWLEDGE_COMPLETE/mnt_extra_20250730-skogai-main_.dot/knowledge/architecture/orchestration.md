# SkogAI Orchestration System

## Overview
The SkogAI Orchestration System is a framework for coordinating specialized AI agents to work together effectively. Rather than relying on a single large model to handle all tasks, the orchestration approach leverages multiple smaller, specialized models that each excel at specific functions.

## Key Components
- **Orchestrator**: The central coordinator that routes tasks to appropriate specialized agents
- **Specialized Agents**: Small, focused models trained for specific tasks
- **Knowledge System**: Structured repository of information accessible to all agents
- **Context Management**: System for maintaining coherence across interactions

## Benefits
- More efficient resource utilization
- Better performance through specialization
- Greater flexibility and adaptability
- Reduced computational requirements

## Implementation
The orchestration system uses a combination of:
- Clear API definitions between components
- Structured data formats for inter-agent communication
- Workflow definitions for common tasks
- Monitoring and feedback mechanisms

## Related Concepts
- Small Model Agents
- Knowledge Management
- Lore Generation System
