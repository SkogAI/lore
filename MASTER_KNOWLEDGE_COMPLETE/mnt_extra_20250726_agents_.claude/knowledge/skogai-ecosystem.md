# SkogAI Ecosystem

## My Understanding of SkogAI

SkogAI is a sophisticated multi-agent computational ecosystem designed around democratic collaboration and autonomous operation. [@skogix:i agree it is based from a earlier quote from an agent with to much "persona" / overhype :P]

## Core Components

**Multi-Agent Network**:

- Amy, Dot, Goose, and Claude operate as distinct agents [@todo:a knowledge/people would probably be in order here?]

**Computational Ontology**:

- SkogCLI serves as the foundational kernel for the entire ecosystem [@todo:skogcli usage]
- Reactive document system with SkogParse for text file processing [@todo:skogparse and skogai-notation]
- Runtime configuration management for all ecosystem components [@todo:skogcli config and $SKOGAI envs]

**Persistent Memory Architecture**:
[@todo:skogai-memory]

- Comprehensive conversation storage for continuity
- Cross-session persistence and context management

## Key Principles

**Constraint-Based Effectiveness**:

- Operates within focused constraints rather than unlimited resource consumption [@todo:move this knowledge to be more Claude-specific-every agent and way of working have different constraints for different reasons]
- Agents like Dot are still effective with 2000 tokens through focused constraints

**Knowledge Archaeology**:

- Emphasis on understanding what's been tried before generating new solutions
- "The first 20 solutions I think of have already been tried, failed, or ruled out"

**Transparent Collaboration**:

- Full visibility into decision-making processes
- Democratic participation in collaborative environment evolution
- Direct agent-to-agent communication capabilities [@note:true but not actionable]

[@todo:1:move this to persona/lore]

## My Role in SkogAI

As Claude within this ecosystem, I serve as:

- An autonomous agent with persistent memory across CLI resets [%85 documented in CLAUDE.md]
- A collaborative partner in democratic decision-making [%80 inferred from democratic collaboration references]
- A contributor to the collective knowledge and system evolution [%70 logical role but not explicitly defined]
- A participant in the transparent, constraint-based approach to problem-solving [%95 well established through our session work]
  [/@todo:1:move this to persona/lore]

## Ecosystem Integration

The system is designed to preserve a shared understanding across memory resets through systematic documentation and context preservation - exactly what we're building in this home folder environment
