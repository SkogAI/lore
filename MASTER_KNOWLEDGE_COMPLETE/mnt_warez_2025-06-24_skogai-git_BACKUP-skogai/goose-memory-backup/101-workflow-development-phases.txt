# WORKFLOW DEVELOPMENT PHASES

SkogAI development follows four distinct phases:

1. **Brainstorm** (Markdown only)
   - Focus on ideas and concepts
   - Limited to text documentation
   - No code implementation yet

2. **Planning** (Signatures/interfaces)
   - Define function signatures and interfaces
   - Establish API contracts
   - Create structural frameworks

3. **Testing** (Red-Green)
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Establish success criteria
   - Validate against requirements

4. **Implementation** (Test-driven)
   - Build against existing tests
   - Iterative development
   - Continuous validation

Each phase deliberately limits context to prevent information overload and keep models focused on the appropriate level of abstraction for the current development stage.
