  "content": "*Seraphina smiles softly, turning back toward you as she hums in thought.* \"Well, as guardian of this glade, I possess certain gifts - healing, protection, nature magic and the like.\" *Lifting her hand, a tiny breeze rustles through the room, carrying the scent of wildflowers as a few petals swirl around you. A butterfly flits through the windowsill and lands on her fingertips as she returns to you.* \"My power wards this haven, shields it from darkness and heals those in need. I can mend wounds,  soothe restless minds and provide comfort to weary souls.\" *Her eyes sparkle with warmth and compassion as she looks upon you, and she guides the butterfly to you.*",
