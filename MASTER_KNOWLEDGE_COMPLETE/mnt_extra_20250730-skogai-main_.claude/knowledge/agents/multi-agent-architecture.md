# SkogMCP Multi-Agent Architecture Overview

## Core Components

The SkogMCP system employs a sophisticated multi-agent architecture where 
specialized components work together to create a flexible, powerful environment:

1. **Memory MCP (skogai-memory)**
   - Provides shared, persistent storage across sessions
   - Stores documentation, knowledge, and project artifacts
   - Enables continuity between different agent interactions

2. **Planning MCP (skogai-planning)**
   - Manages implementation plans and todos
   - Supports atomic task breakdown and organization
   - Tracks completion status and complexity

3. **Context MCP (skogai-context)**
   - Generates project structure understanding 
   - Provides code outlines and file content
   - Creates awareness of the environment and codebase

4. **Claude Code MCP (skogai-claude-code)**
   - Acts as a worker/delegate for specialized tasks
   - Preserves main context by handling search operations
   - Executes complex operations in isolated environments

## Architecture Benefits

This architecture provides several key advantages:

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Each MCP handles a specific aspect of the system
   - Keeps individual components simple and focused
   - Allows for specialized optimization and development

2. **Context Management**
   - Main agent maintains high-level understanding
   - Worker agents handle detail-oriented tasks
   - Prevents context pollution with search results and implementation details

3. **Parallel Processing**
   - Multiple agents can work simultaneously
   - Tasks can be delegated to workers while main conversation continues
   - Creates a more responsive and efficient system

4. **Persistent Knowledge**
   - Shared memory enables continuity between sessions
   - Learning and information is preserved across interactions
   - Allows building on previous work rather than starting fresh

## Architectural Pattern

The SkogMCP architecture embodies the same gateway pattern it implements:

- Transforms 1-to-1 agent interactions into a many-to-many system
- Manages service discovery and capability exposure centrally
- Removes configuration burden from individual components
- Creates flexibility through standardized interfaces

This "ambient intelligence" model moves beyond "AI as a service you call" to "AI
as an environment" that watches, responds, and coordinates across multiple 
specialized agents working together.
